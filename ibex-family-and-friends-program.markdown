  ***“The trip has transformed our lives and has given us a new, fresh perspective on our daily readings of God’s Word. Though we did not spend a month in Israel and only a week, the places we visited and knowledge we gained was an incredible blessing… Our trip to Israel left us with a yearning to return and as we read God’s Word to be able to visualize the words on paper in our minds!”***

  **Jack Faust, 2015 F&F participant**

  ***"We were so thankful to have a tour guide like Dr. Grisanti--his insights, in-depth knowledge of the Bible, and 'contagious' love for history exceeded our expectations for the tour... The support material and literature provided laid a solid foundation for seeing and touring each site and has been used countless times since returning home and ‘reliving’ and sorting out all we saw and experienced... Since touring Israel, I noticed that I have been much more aware of and mindful of this year’s Passion Week. I have a deeper understanding and perspective of Christ’s final week on earth, and helpful memories and greater awareness of the events surrounding Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. My husband John and I are very thankful that we were able to travel with the 2015 Family and Friends tour of Israel and are encouraging others to seriously consider and prefer a tour lead by TMU/TMS."***

At the core of our Family and Friends trip to Israel are the parents and relatives who have children attending at The Master’s University IBEX campus. However, we also open the trip to those who may have no direct connection to IBEX or TMU. We invite you to join tour guide, Dr. Michael Grisanti, for a ten day trip to Israel in March 2017. The Family & Friends Program is arranged to make it possible for you to not only visit Israel and explore the historical and biblical sites, but to also be introduced to our IBEX program. Opportunities for several meals and fun times together with the students have been arranged. Some sites of significance on the itinerary include the Sea of Galilee and Galilee region, the Shephelah, the Dead Sea, the Jordan River, and of course, Jerusalem.

Our trip is not a slow moving tourist trip, but a fun and engaging study trip. Our desire is to help each participant better understand the land of the Bible through our time together. We will provide a unique atlas and study notes to help you follow along with the instruction. We will do a fair bit of walking to several sites and ride the bus for other stops.
