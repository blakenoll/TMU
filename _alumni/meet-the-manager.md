title: Meet The Manager
---

"What a privilege I have to serve at The Master's University as the Alumni Relations Manager! It is truly a blessing to work at the college I have loved and respected for so long."

While Catering Manager at Spanish Hills Golf & Country Club, Shayna first heard of The Master's University at the 1996 Golf Tournament. When the Lord saved her later that year, Shayna looked into attending TMU. However, it was not until much later that the Lord sovereignly directed her steps back to TMU. In 2008, Shayna began the fall semester in the traditional program. Afterward, she was able to switch to the Degree Completion Program, earning her bachelor's degree in Biblical Counseling in 2011.

Prior to working at the University, Shayna worked at Santa Clarita Christian School. During the four years she worked at SCCS, she organized several projects and held many positions, including Bible teacher, Parent Advisory Committee Coordinator, and Alumni Relations Coordinator. Shayna states, "It is my joy to be at The Master's University utilizing my experience and giftedness to serve my fellow alumni!"

Shayna has one daughter from her deceased husband. Through her testimony, she is able to tell of God's lovingkindness to her and to her family.

### A Favorite Scripture Verse: Romans 12:1-2

"Therefore, I urge you brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
