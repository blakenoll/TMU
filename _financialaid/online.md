  ## Financial Aid 101: The Basics

  *“How will I pay for my education? Am I eligible for financial aid? Where do I begin?”*

  The Office of Financial Aid can answer your questions. Whether you are a high school student, a college transfer, or an inquiring parent, we are here to help. Our aim is to provide you with a premium education at a price that considers your personal financial situation.\* Premium education, personal price.\*

  ### Types of Financial Aid

  There are two basic types of financial aid: gift aid and self-help aid. Gift aid refers to financial assistance that does not need to be repaid (i.e. scholarships or grants). Self-help aid is assistance that holds the recipient responsible for some sort of return (i.e. loans, work study). Funding from private sources (i.e. associations, religious groups, or corporations) also fall within these two groups.

  ### The Process

  *Applying for financial aid can be intimidating, but that is why we have made the process as streamlined as possible. The steps are simple:*

  1\. Submit a [TMU Financial Aid Application](http://www.masters.edu/onlineforms).

  2\. Complete the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/).

  3\. Submit all documents requested by the Office of Financial Aid. Missing documents can be viewed through your [Self-Service](https://portal.masters.edu/SelfService/Finances/FinancialAid.aspx).

  4\. If you are required for verification by the government please complete the [IRS Data Retrieval](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) and [Federal Verification Worksheet](http://www.masters.edu/onlineforms). Step-by-step verification information can be viewed on our [Verification page](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/verification-process).

  5\. Receive your award letter and accept your awards online through [Self-Service](https://www2.masters.edu/edit/StudentResources/FinAidAward.asp).

  ### Communication

  Good communication with the Office of Financial Aid is essential to your financial success. You will not receive blanket mass letters from our office\*. If we contact you, it is because we require the information we are requesting.\*

  Our communication process is directly connected to your personal account. Each letter, email, or postcard you receive from the Office of Financial Aid relates\* \*to your specific situation, so be careful to respond promptly to all communication attempts.

  ## **Important Dates**

  • December: Request pin for the FAFSA

  • January: Begin completing the FAFSA

  • February: Complete IRS Data Retrieval or IRS Tax Transcript

  • March 2nd: California [Cal Grant](http://www.csac.ca.gov/doc.asp?id=48) eligible high school students, transcripts need to be verified and sent to [CSAC](http://www.csac.ca.gov/).

  ## Federal Verification Process for Online and Degree Completion

  When you submit the [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the Web, you may be randomly selected by the Federal processor for a process called “verification.” This means the Department of Education requires our office to determine the accuracy of the information provided on your [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the Web application. If you receive this notification, please complete the following steps in compliance with Federal guidelines.

  NOTE: The priority deadline is March 2nd. The following steps must be completed before March 2nd to be considered for priority awarding.

  ## **Verification Steps:**

  * Complete the IRS Data Retrieval through [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the Web (See our [IRS Data Retrieval Guide](http://www.masters.edu/media/867479/fafsa-irs-data-retrieval-rev.pdf "FAFSA IRS Data Retrieval rev.pdf")).


  * Submit the Federal Verification Worksheet to the Office of Financial Aid.

    * [2018-19 Federal Verification Worksheet](/uploads/Forms-%20MI-%20FVW%2018-19-44a72b.pdf)

    * [2017-18 Federal Verification Worksheet](http://www.masters.edu/media/868376/forms-mi-fvw-2017-18.pdf "Forms- MI- FVW 2017-18.pdf")


  * Sign and submit our [Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpprintforms/).


  * Submit all documents listed above and/or requested by the Office of Financial Aid by March 2nd for priority awarding.

  ## **What is the IRS Data Retrieval?**

  The IRS Data Retrieval is a feature of [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the web, which links your FAFSA with your already filed federal tax information through the IRS. You may update your FAFSA by linking to your federal taxes and pulling your tax data directly from the IRS ‘auto-filling” the tax portion of your FAFSA. Taxes submitted electronically require 2-3 weeks before they can be requested. If they were submitted by paper, they will require up to 8-11 weeks. If you do not wish to complete the IRS Data retrieval and are required for verification, you must contact the IRS to request a copy of student and/or parent’s IRS tax transcript to provide to The Office of Financial Aid (See below, “Requesting an IRS transcript”).

  **How to use the IRS Data Retrieval:**

  See our [IRS Data Retrieval Step by Step Guide](http://www.masters.edu/media/867479/fafsa-irs-data-retrieval-rev.pdf)

  NOTE: The student and parent must go to the IRS separately. Please ensure that you have a valid Social Security Number and have already filed taxes for the previous year.

  **What if I Cannot Complete the IRS Data Retrieval?**

  If you cannot complete Step 1 (above), you may request an IRS transcript and submit it to the Office of Financial Aid. (See our guide on [How to Request an IRS Tax Transcript](http://www.masters.edu/media/867477/irs-website-retrieval-rev.pdf)). You must request an IRS transcript if:

  • You (or your parent) did not use the IRS Data Retrieval Process either at initial FAFSA filing or through subsequent corrections.

  • You changed information after using the IRS Data retrieval process.• Your tax status is ‘Married, filing separately.’

  • Your parents filed separate tax returns.

  • You (or your parent) had a change in marital status after the end of the tax year on December 31.

  • You (or your parent) filed an amended tax return.

  • You filed taxes outside the U.S.

  **Requesting an IRS Tax Return Transcript:**

  1. On the [IRS website](http://www.irs.gov/transcripts) choose “Get Transcript of Your Tax Records” or call 800.908.9946 and request the transcript by phone (See our guide on [How to Request an IRS Tax Transcript](http://www.masters.edu/media/867477/irs-website-retrieval-rev.pdf)). You may also request one in writing by completing the [IRS form 4506T-EZ](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506tez.pdf) and mailing it to the IRS.

  2. Select the method by which you wish to receive your Tax Return Transcript.

  3. Fill in the requested information and request the (Tax) Return Transcript.

  4. Once you receive your transcript submit it to the Office of Financial Aid for verification.

  ## Tuition and Fees

  The Master’s University strives to offer students a Christ-centered education within the financial reach of all. We endeavor to keep costs as low as possible, and consequently, our tuition is among the most economical for a private university. When calculating university costs, be sure to consider the total cost. Consider items like: books and supplies, transportation, and personal spending money. While these amounts vary with each student, it can raise the total cost of education above the published tuition and room and board amounts. Fortunately, when computing a student’s financial need, we take all these costs into consideration.

  **2017-2018 Financial Information**


  * General Education Courses, per unit     $265

  * Major Courses, per unit                                $450

  * High School Students, per unit                $150


  ## Deposits and Fees

  # **Books**

  Typical cost for books each semester ranges from $200 to $400, payable directly to the Campus Bookstore at time of purchase.

  # **Course and Notebook Computer Fees**
  * Some courses have specific fees which are noted on the course schedule.
  * All full-time students are required to have a notebook computer. Students must ensure their computer meets minimum configuration specifications. For more information, see [Computer Services](http://www.masters.edu/computer-services/).

  \*The Master’s University reserves the right to change, without notice, any charges, fees or policies listed on this website.

  ### Answers

  How much does it cost to attend The Master’s University?

  For Degree Completion tuition and fees, [click here](http://www.masters.edu/academics/degreecompletion/prospective-students/tuition/ "DCOLP Tuition and Fees").

  For Online Degree tuition and fees, [click here](http://www.masters.edu/academics/online/tuition-and-fees/). ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  Do I have to apply for aid every year?

  Yes. Your aid eligibility will be evaluated each year, based on the information you provide on the current year’s FAFSA and the Financial Aid Application. ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  What are the deadlines? When do I apply for financial aid at The Master’s University?

  You are strongly encouraged to submit your FAFSA between January 1 and January 31. If January 31 has passed, we recommend filling out the FAFSA as soon as possible. All other forms should be received no later then March 2 before the academic year for which aid is needed. If the priority deadline is not met, a student may still apply, but funding for certain aid programs may be exhausted. ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  What if my financial circumstances change?

  We encourage you to notify the Office of Financial Aid if your financial situation has changed since you completed the FAFSA, or if there are rare/special circumstances in your family’s finances you feel have not been considered. Please document and be prepared to submit, in detail, any expenses, income changes or other information. ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  When will I hear from the Office of Financial Aid regarding how much financial aid I will be receiving?

  Once all necessary documents are received, students are awarded on a first come, first serve basis. Award notification usually begins in the middle of March and occurs on a weekly basis, typically within 3 to 4 weeks of the time all documents are received. ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  What do I do once I have received my award letter?

  Once you receive your award letter, you will simply need to log on to your Self-Service account to accept or decline your awards. Detailed instructions for this process are included in your award letter. New students are given a Self-Service login and password when they are accepted to the university. Please contact your Admissions Counselor if you have forgotten your password. ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  How many units per semester must I take to receive financial aid?

  To receive most financial aid you must be enrolled at least half-time (6 units). If you are considering taking less than 6 units, you should contact the Office of Financial Aid immediately to see how this would affect your aid. ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))

  Can international students receive financial aid?

  Yes. Detailed information about applying for financial aid as an international student can be found [here](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/# "Aid").

  Can I access my financial aid information on Self-Service?

  Yes. If you have been accepted to the university or are an enrolled student with a [Self-Service account](https://portal.masters.edu/SelfService/Home.aspx "Self-Service"). ([Return to Top](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/onlinedcp/dcolpfaqs/#questions_top))
