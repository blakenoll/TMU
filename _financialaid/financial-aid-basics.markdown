## Financial Aid 101: The Basics

“How will I pay for my education? Am I eligible for financial aid? Where do I begin?”

The Office of Financial Aid can answer your questions. Whether you are a high school student, a college transfer, or an inquiring parent, we are here to help. Our aim is to provide you with a premium education at a price that considers your personal financial situation. *Premium education, personal price.*

### Types of Financial Aid

There are two basic types of financial aid: gift aid and self-help aid. Gift aid refers to financial assistance that does not need to be repaid (i.e. scholarships or grants). Self-help aid is assistance that holds the recipient responsible for some sort of return (i.e. loans, work study). Funding from private sources (i.e. associations, religious groups, or corporations) also fall within these two groups.

### The Process

Applying for financial aid can be intimidating, but that is why we have made the process as streamlined as possible. The steps are simple:

1. Submit a TMU [Financial Aid Application](http://www.masters.edu/media/868502/forms-application-faa.pdf "Forms- Application- FAA.pdf").

2. Complete the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/).

3. Submit all documents requested by the Office of Financial Aid. Missing documents can be viewed through your [Self-Service](https://portal.masters.edu/SelfService/Finances/FinancialAid.aspx).

4. Receive your award letter and accept your awards online through [Self-Service](https://www2.masters.edu/edit/StudentResources/FinAidAward.asp).

5. If you have not yet been accepted to the university, you can still begin the financial aid process, but it is more streamlined once you are accepted and receive a username and password to access your information online.

6. If you are required for verification by the government please complete the [IRS Data Retrieval](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) and [Federal Verification Worksheet](/uploads/Forms-%20MI-%20FVW%2018-19-44a72b.pdf). Step-by-step verification information can be viewed on our [Verification page](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/verification-process).

### Communication

Good communication with the Office of Financial Aid is essential to your financial success. You will not receive blanket mass letters from our office.\* If we contact you, it is because we require the information we are requesting.\*

Our communication process is directly connected to your personal account. Each letter, email, or postcard you receive from the Office of Financial Aid relates to your specific situation, so be careful to respond promptly to all communication attempts.
