## Federal Verification Process

When you submit the [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the Web, you may be randomly selected by the Federal processor for a process called “verification.” This means the Department of Education requires our office to determine the accuracy of the information provided on your [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the Web application. If you receive this notification, please complete the following steps in compliance with Federal guidelines.

NOTE: The priority deadline is March 2nd. The following steps must be completed before March 2nd to be considered for priority awarding.

### Verification Steps:

* Complete the IRS Data Retrieval through [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the Web (See our [IRS Data Retrieval Guide](http://www.masters.edu/media/867479/fafsa-irs-data-retrieval-rev.pdf "FAFSA IRS Data Retrieval rev.pdf")).

* Submit the Federal Verification Worksheet to the Office of Financial Aid.

* Sign and submit our [Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy](http://www.masters.edu/media/868183/undergrad-satisfactory-academic-progress-policy.pdf "Undergrad - Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy.pdf").

* Submit all documents listed above and/or requested by the Office of Financial Aid by March 2nd for priority awarding. Some scholarships and grants may require additional forms, which can be found [here](http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/financial-aid/generalundergraduateprogram/newandtransfer.aspx).

### What is the IRS Data Retrieval?

The IRS Data Retrieval is a feature of [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) on the web, which links your FAFSA with your already filed federal tax information through the IRS. You may update your FAFSA by linking to your federal taxes and pulling your tax data directly from the IRS ‘auto-filling” the tax portion of your FAFSA. Taxes submitted electronically require 2-3 weeks before they can be requested. If they were submitted by paper, they will require up to 8-11 weeks. If you do not wish to complete the IRS Data retrieval and are required for verification, you must contact the IRS to request a copy of student and/or parent’s IRS tax transcript to provide to The Office of Financial Aid (See below, “Requesting an IRS transcript”).

### How to use the IRS Data Retrieval:

See our [IRS Data Retrieval Step by Step Guide](http://www.masters.edu/media/868615/info-verification-fafsa-irs-data-retrieval.pdf "Info- Verification- FAFSA IRS Data Retrieval.pdf").

NOTE: The student and parent must go to the IRS separately. Please ensure that you have a valid Social Security Number and have already filed taxes for the previous year.

### What if I Cannot Complete the IRS Data Retrieval?

If you cannot complete Step 1 (above), you may request an IRS transcript and submit it to the Office of Financial Aid. (See our guide on [How to Request an IRS Tax Transcript)](http://www.masters.edu/media/868798/info-verification-irs-transcript-request-rev.pdf "Info- Verification- IRS Transcript Request rev.pdf"). You must request an IRS transcript if:

• You (or your parent) did not use the IRS Data Retrieval Process either at initial FAFSA filing or through subsequent corrections.\
• You changed information after using the IRS Data retrieval process.\
• Your tax status is ‘Married, filing separately.’\
• Your parents filed separate tax returns.\
• You (or your parent) had a change in marital status after the end of the tax year on December 31.\
• You (or your parent) filed an amended tax return.\
• You filed taxes outside the U.S.

### Requesting an IRS Transcript:

1. On the [IRS website](http://www.irs.gov/) choose “Get Transcript of Your Tax Records” or call 800.908.9946 and request the transcript by phone (See our guide on [How to Request an IRS Tax Transcript](http://www.masters.edu/media/868798/info-verification-irs-transcript-request-rev.pdf "Info- Verification- IRS Transcript Request rev.pdf")). You may also request one in writing by completing the [IRS form 4506T-EZ](https://www.irs.gov/uac/About-Form-4506T) and mailing it to the IRS.

2. Select the "Get Transcript by Mail" option.

3. Fill in the requested information and request the Return Transcript.

4. Once you receive your transcript submit it to the Office of Financial Aid for verification.
