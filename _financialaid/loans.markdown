  ## Federal Direct Stafford Loans

  The Master’s University & Seminary participates in the Federal Direct Loan Student Program (FDSLP) which began with the 2010-2011 school year. In this program, the federal government acts as the lender referred to as “Direct Loans,” and the Stafford Loans are serviced by familiar agencies such as Sallie Mae, Great Lakes, PHEAA, and Nelnet. All new and continuing students who accept Stafford Loans will be required to complete the following steps unless they have done so in prior years. (Please click on the links below.)

  1. [Entrance Loan Counseling](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action) is an on-line tutorial about the Stafford Loan(s) you have accepted. The session takes about 30 minutes to finish and is required before the funds for your loan(s) can be processed. Click on “Sign In” and enter your government PIN. Be sure to complete the quiz at the end. (Search “Master’s” to find our school.)

  2. The [Master Promissory Note](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action) is the loan application or “promise to pay.” Click on “Sign In” to get started. You will need to provide two references with separate addresses. Use your government PIN to e-sign this document.

  2. **Will my credit be checked?**
     Yes. A parent borrower can request a credit check on the Direct Loan website, or the school can do it.

  3. **If I have questions about the Direct Loan PLUS Loan program, where can I go for more information?**
     Parents can [click here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus) for more information about PLUS loans, or call the Direct Loan Origination Center (Applicant Services) 1-800-557-7394.

     Yes, all PLUS loans for each borrower can be consolidated into the Direct Loan program.

  6. **If I have another Direct PLUS loan from another school, do I need to complete a new MPN?**

  9. **How do I add an endorser to my PLUS loan?**
     Your endorser will need to add themselves to your PLUS loan. They will need their own FSA ID, which they can apply for at[ ](http://www.masters.edu/umbraco/fsaid.ed.gov)[fsaid.ed.gov](http://fsaid.ed.gov/). To complete their addition to your application they will need your PLUS loan application confirmation number, which can be found under the "PLUS Loan Requests" link on the left-hand side after you log into [www.studentloans.gov](http://www.studentloans.gov/). Once they have this number, they can select the "Complete Endorser Addenda" link.

  Can't find your question? Email [the Financial Aid Office](mailto:financialaid@masters.edu).

  ### Answers...

  **Why are loans called “awards”?**
  Although loans must be repaid, they are considered a financial aid award because they are part of the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, one of many programs offered by the federal government to financially assist students. The Office of Financial Aid “awards” Stafford loans to students along with any other aid they are eligible to receive.

  **What are my loan choices?**
  Students can be awarded Federal Stafford or Federal Perkins loans. In addition, parents may borrow fixed interest rate [PLUS LOANS](http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/loans/directplusloans/ "directplusloans"). Students may also apply for variable interest rate co-signer [PRIVATE LOANS](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/Welcome.do?configId=1352380267587). Contact the Office of Financial Aid at 661-362-2290 or financialaid@masters.edu to discuss these options.

  **What is a Federal Stafford Loan?**
  A Federal Stafford loan is a low-interest rate loan offered by the Federal Government to students enrolled at least half-time (6 units). They are offered as subsidized or unsubsidized loans as determined by the FAFSA, and students enter re-payment 6 months after they graduate or drop below 6 units.

  **What is the difference between Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans?**
  Subsidized loans: Interest accrued is paid by the federal government while students are enrolled at least half-time (6 units) and during a 6 month grace period. Unsubsidized loans: Students are responsible to pay all interest accrued for the life of the loan; the interest accrued is capitalized at repayment (students can choose to pay interest while in school to prevent it from capitalizing).

  **How do I apply for Stafford Loans?**
  Loans are automatically offered to eligible students with their initial award. The type of loan received as well as the amount of the loan is based on grade level and need, as determined by the FAFSA; no additional request needs to be made by the student.

  **What is Entrance Loan Counseling?**
  Entrance Loan Counseling is a short on-line tutorial regarding a student’s rights and responsibilities as it pertains to Stafford loans. It is required by the federal government and must be completed before loan funds are placed on a student’s account. The [Online Tutorial](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action) generally takes 15-20 minutes to complete.

  **What is a Consolidation Loan?**
  A consolidated loan is one that simplifies repayment of federal Stafford and/or Perkins loans by combining all the loans from your educational career into one comprehensive loan. Consolidation can be performed once, and will have an interest rate with a weighted average of all the loans being consolidated.

  **What is a Parent PLUS Loan?**
  A Parent PLUS Loan is a low-interest rate loan offered (pending pre-approval by a major lender) by the Federal Government to parents of students enrolled at least half-time (6 units). The amount borrowed is limited by a student’s budget and is payable 60 days after last disbursement.

  **What if my parent is declined for a PLUS Loan?**
  If a parent receives a PLUS loan denial, you may be eligible for an additional unsubsidized Stafford Loan. Freshmen and Sophomores are eligible for up to $4,000; Juniors and Seniors are eligible for up to $5,000.

  **I have additional questions. How can I contact you?**

loan-deferment-body: |-
  **Loan Deferment**

  Students who have taken out Stafford loans are eligible for deferment as long as they are enrolled in a program at least half-time. Unsubsidized loans will still accrue interest, and subsidized loans will cease accruing interest until a student drops below half-time again or graduates. Half-time status is defined as follows:

  * Undergraduate: 6 units

  * M.Div: 5.5 units

  * MABS, MABC/SIP, D.Min, MAE: 4 units

  * Th.M: 2 units

  **Loans might not be deferred automatically once you re-enter school. To request a deferment, please follow these steps:**

  1. Fill out an in-school deferment request form by clicking on the following link:\
     [In School Deferment Request Form](http://www.masters.edu/media/868613/forms-ln-deferment-in-school-deferment-request.pdf "Forms- LN- Deferment- In School Deferment Request.pdf")

  2. Fill out your information on the request form. Please leave the section which has your enrollment dates and graduation date blank.

  3. Send the form to the Office of Financial Aid at 661-362-2693 (Fax) or financialaid@masters.edu (email).

  4. The registrar will verify your units and notify the servicer on your behalf. If you are in a graduate program, it may be necessary to defer your loan each year.
