  We are happy to say that—while The Master’s University is not able to give students a full scholarship—we do offer significant funds for qualified international students. We understand that this is a difficult process requiring a great deal of effort and faith. We are praying with you that God’s provision and guidance would be clear to you through this process.

  About The Ministry Matching Grant

  ### Eligibility

  Any student accepted and enrolled full-time at The Master's University who receives a scholarship from their local church is eligible for the Ministry Matching Grant (MMG). Both the church's scholarship and the MMG will be applied directly to the student's account and will be split between the Fall and Spring semesters.

  ### Amount

  The Master's University will match the church's scholarship gift dollar-for-dollar. New ministry-match scholarship recipients for the 2015-16 academic year can receive up to $1,500 per year and ministry match scholarships that students have received in past years will be matched up to the previous year's amount. There is no minimum or maximum amount that a church can give for the scholarship. However, the matching portion from The Master's University will never exceed the stated amount above or the matched amount from a previous year. Please contact the [Office of Financial Aid](mailto:financialaid@masters.edu) for specific questions.

  ### Funding

  Churches can handle their scholarships in a variety of ways. Some churches fund scholarships from their annual budget; others take a special offering. Please visit our "[Establishing Funds](http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/financial-aid/generalundergraduateprogram/mmgestablishingfunds.aspx)" page for examples of how to setup and fund your scholarship

  ### Renewal

  Students may receive this matching grant for up to four years. A new Ministry Matching Grant Application must be completed and accompany the church's scholarship each year. If a church decides to award a larger scholarship in a following year, the current year's matching funds from TMU will never exceed the matched funds from a previous year.

  ### Designation

  Only the church can select the students as recipients. Church members, parents, or relatives cannot designate their gifts for specific students. All church contributions must meet IRS guidelines for charitable deductions. To find out more, refer to [IRS publication 526](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Publication-526,-Charitable-Contributions-1).

  ### Deadline

  Both the check and the application must be postmarked no later than August 1st, and both must be received in order to be eligible for the matching grant.

  ### Process

  The process begins with an application. The student's personal information should be completed and then given to the church to completed the remaining portions. Both the check and the application should then be submitted to TMU.

  ### Application

  An application can be retrieved at the Office of Financial Aid or [downloaded](/uploads/Forms-%20Application-%20MMG.pdf) from the internet.

  ### Payment
