Waldock Hall was completed in 1990 as part of an expansion project to accomodate the growing student population following Dr. John MacArthur's coming as President of the school in 1985. Dixon and Sweazy Halls were a part of that expansion as well. The hall is named after Dr. Frederick W. Waldock. Dr. Waldock and his wife Dorothy were pioneering missionaries in northern India for almost forty years. Dr. Waldock was a frequent speaker at the school's mission conference. Their children attended what was then Los Angeles Baptist College and so his family was closely connected with the school. He was awarded an honorary doctorate for his contribution to missions. Waldock Hall was just recently renovated in 2010 with new furnishings, fixtures and carpeting.

### What is Waldock Hall like?

Waldock is a two-story buidling in a shape of a flattened-"V". In the middle are two lounges, one on each floor with great views of the Placerita Canyon. The Resident Director apartment is located in the middle as well on the second story.

The dorm is divided into four wings, one per-floor-per-side of 10-11 rooms each with a large central shower and restroom area and laundry facilities. Each room is fully furnished for two students including beds, built-in shelving, drawers, and closet space and desks. Waldock is centrally heated and cooled. The wings are normally referred to as "Upper-East", "Upper-West", "Lower-East", "Lower-West" with reference to their location from the central dorm entrance in the first-story lounge.
