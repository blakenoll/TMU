    ## Fast Facts:

    ### A Favorite Scripture Verse: Hebrews 12:1-3

    "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted."

    I was previously working as a behaviorist with students with special needs when the Lord opened the door for me to serve as a RD. I previously served for 2 years as a RA in CDUB and loved my time there so I am really excited to be back to serve as the RD there. I love seeing how the Lord graciously uses students and staff to encourage one another and point each other back to the gospel!

    ### A Favorite Scripture Verse: 1 Peter 1:3-5

    "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."

    ### Some Favorite Activities:

    I love coffee, being in the mountains, hiking, traveling, learning about new cultures, going to the Flower Market, and spending time with family and friends.

C.W. Smith Hall is the newest dorm on campus (often called "C-dub"). It was completed in Spring 2003 to alleviate the need for the college to house growing numbers of students in off-campus rented apartments. In fact, students were moved mid-semester from the off-campus apartments (named Oak Tree and Manzanita) into the newly finished dorm in an effort that nearly the entire campus participated in--accomplishing the huge task in one afternoon.

Smith Hall was named in honor of the beloved Bible professor Charles W. Smith. He came to the school in 1987 and was a favorite of students for his general bible class on the book of Romans and other upper division theology and greek classes. Before he retired but after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he gave the [2002 Commencement Address ](http://www2.masters.edu/pulpit/files/2002/Spring-'02/20020512-CWSmith-mp3 "2002 Commencement Address")with the memorable line "These are the things for the past 50 years I've tried to give my students to teach them how to live...and now it is time to teach you how to die." He dedicated 50 years of his life to educating Christian young people, 35 years at Bob Jones University and the last 15 years at The Master's University. He went to be with the Lord in 2003. There is a C.W. Smith Biblical Endowment fund to give scholarships to students studying biblical languages and theology.

## What is C.W. Smith Hall like?

C.W. Smith Hall is a three-story building in a slight-"V" shape. Between two large wings of rooms are: two spacious lounges on the first and third floors with spectacular views of the Santa Clarita Valley, a large laundry facility on the second story, and two apartments for the Resident Directors on the second and third stories.

The dorm is divided into six wings, two men's wings on the bottom floor and four women's wings on the second and third floors. Each wing has a large central shower and restroom area and 13-14 rooms. Each room is fully furnished for two students including beds, built-in shelving, drawers, closet space, desks, and an individual heater/air-conitioner unit. The wings are normally referred to as "Upper-East", "Upper-West", "Middle-East", "Middle-West", "Lower-East", and "Lower-West" with reference to their location from the central dorm entrance on the first-story lounge. Because of its relatively recent consturction C.W. Smith is the only dorm with an elevator and so is fully ADA-compliant.
