    John is a local native to Santa Clarita. After spending one year away in Oregon studying ministry he came back with passion for the church. He worked several various jobs as he completed his B.A. in Psychology online through Liberty University. Previous to TMU he worked at a local private school teaching fourth grade as he thought to pursue his M.A. in Education. Simultaneous to pursuing school to enhance his career in Education, he applied to seminary knowing that God has gifted him for ministry. He made the switch in January 2016 to begin his seminary education. In the process he heard about the potential opportunity to work as a Resident Director at TMU. He joined TMU in 2016 and is in process of his Masters of Divinity at TMS. He is excited for the opportunity to disciple the young men of Slight Hall as they walk together daily pursing a deeper love for the Lord, His Word, and His people.

    ## Fast Facts:

    ### A Favorite Scripture Verse: Ephesians 2:4-7
    “But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.”

    ### Some Favorite Things:
    John enjoys things active and things creative. Hiking and rock climbing are two of his favorite physical activities while cooking and sketching satisfy his creative side. What he enjoys most is learning new things about Scripture, life, people, etc. A good cup of coffee and a good conversation is his favorite way to spend free time.

Slight Hall was finished in time for the fall 1978 school year. The Hall was named in honor of the long time chairman of the Board of Directors Ralph S. Slight. Other happenings at the school that year include R.W. Mackey joining the school as Dean of Students and Jim Owen joining the faculty of the History department. The dorm is scheduled for complete renovation soon including updating the layout of each apartment unit, new furnishings, fixture and carpet.

Ralph S. Slight was elected to the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Baptist seminary in 1946 and named chairman in 1947. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree the same year at commencement exercises. He served the school faithfully in that capacity long into Dr. Dunkin's term as president. He lead the school through many changes such as moving the campus to Placerita Canyon in 1960 and much of the initial development of that property. He stepped down from the Board when his family moved to northern California in 1970.

### What is Slight Hall like?

Slight is a two-story building with apartment-style dorm rooms. It is layed-out as five apartments each per level on the front and back. The Resident Director lives in one of the apartments on "Lower-Front".

Each apartment is divided into a "big" front room for three or four students and "small" side room for two students, each with its own room air-conditioner. Each room has its own spacious shower and restroom. The wings are normally referred to as "Upper-Back", "Lower-Back", "Upper-Front" and Upper-Back" referencing their location based on the orientation of the dorm to the main road running in front of the building.
