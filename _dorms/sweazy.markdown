Although not an alumna of TMU, she was greatly impacted by alumni of the college from a small church plant in Wyoming during her undergraduate years. The Lord brought Marie to CA in August 2015 to begin a Master of Arts in Biblical Counseling and she is incredibly thankful to have the privilege of working in the Student Life Department at TMU. She has a passion to help people be bold and explicit communicators of the Gospel message to the lost in every available circumstance, and enjoys helping college students think Biblically in every area of their lives. She is a member at Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, CA.

    ## Fast Facts:

    ### A Favorite Scripture Verse: 1 Peter 5:6-11

    "Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen."

    ### Some Favorite Things:

    Marie enjoys getting to know people deeply through normal life activities. Especially sunset watching, walks, and talks in average places. She is obsessed with her three nephews, Phoenix, Jack and Oliver. She loves a good documentary, the local church, the color gray, and evangelism.

Sweazy was completed in 1990 as part of an expansion project to accomodate the growing student population following Dr. John MacArthur's coming as President of the school in 1985. Dixon and Waldock Halls were a part of that expansion as well. The hall is named after Carl M. Sweazy, a professor at the school in the 1940's and 50's. He was the school's president from 1955-1959. He was instrumental in bringing several other prominent faculty to the school including Milton Fish and Herbert Hotchkiss. These men together would bring the school through a tenuous time of financial pressure and external pressure to merge with another Baptist college.

### What is Sweazy Hall like?

Sweazy is a two-story building. Between two wings of rooms, are two lounges, one on each floor. The Resident Director apartment is located in the middle as well on the second story. The dorm is divided into four wings, one per-floor-per-side of 10-12 rooms each with a large central shower and restroom area and laundry facilities. Each room is fully furnished for two students including beds, built-in shelving, drawers, and closet space and desks. Rooms have their own individual heater/air-conditioner unit. The wings are normally referred to as "Upper-East", "Upper-West", "Lower-East", "Lower-West" with reference to their location from the central dorm entrance in the second-story lounge.
