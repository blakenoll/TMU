- name: Abigail Tarr
  title: Resident  Director
  body-text: |-
    Abbey Tarr is originally from South Florida but graduated from Liberty University in 2016. She graduated with a B.S. degree in Music and Worship. She hopes to one day take part in the music ministry of a church. Her husband, Dan, is in his second year at the Master’s Seminary and so she also has hopes of one day being a Pastor’s wife. Abbey is excited to be a resident director this year as she has a love for discipleship and wants to continue to grow in the knowledge of Scripture and relationship.

    Favorite Verse:

    1 Thessalonians 2:8. “So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.”

    Favorite things to do:

    Abbey loves the outdoors—no matter what that entails. She loves to play volleyball at the beach, go for long walks, recreational sports, or eating ice cream while watching the sunset. She also loves to sing and to worship God through music. She loves spending time with family, especially her husband. Their favorite hobby to do together is to play soccer as it reminds them of how they met.

Dixon was completed in 1990 as part of an expansion project to accomodate the growing student population following Dr. John MacArthur's coming as President of the school in 1985. Waldock and Sweazy Halls were a part of that expansion as well. The hall is named after Frank R. Dixon, a generous donor to the college that funded its construction.

### What is Dixon Hall like?

Dixon is a two-story building. Between two wings of rooms are two lounges, one on each floor. The Resident Director apartment is located in the middle as well on the second story.

The dorm is divided into four wings, one per-floor-per-side of 10-12 rooms each with a large central shower and restroom area and laundry facilities. Each room is fully furnished for two students including beds, built-in shelving, drawers, closet space, desks, and an individual heater/air-conditioner unit. The wings are normally referred to as "Upper-East", "Upper-West", "Lower-East", "Lower-West" with reference to their location from the central dorm entrance in the second-story lounge.
