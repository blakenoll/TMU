- name: Alexander Rappe
  title: Men's Resident Director
  body-text: |-
    Alex is from Spokane, Washington. He moved to Los Angeles to attend the Master’s Seminary so that he could be better equipped to obey the Great Commission both here and abroad. Long term, he plans to serve in the work of church planting where the Gospel is not currently being preached. Alex graduated from Moody Bible Institute with a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Studies and Intercultural Studies. He loves discipleship and is eager to come alongside the students at The Master’s University who live off campus, and help them know, love, and serve Christ in every area of their lives.

    **Fast Facts:**

    **A Favorite Scripture Verse: 2 Corinthians 4:5-6**

    “For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus' sake. For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”

    **Some Favorite Things:**

    Alex loves food; yes eating it, and cooking it, but more so growing and cultivating it (gardening, beekeeping, cheese making, fermenting and canning foods, etc…). He also loves to get away from the city, especially to the mountains and go hiking or camping. All of these things he enjoys far more, and enjoys doing almost anything when doing them with his brothers and sisters in Christ.
