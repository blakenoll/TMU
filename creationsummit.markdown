# The Creation Summit: Creationism in the 21st Century

Secular humanism consistently attacks the Bible through its attempts to scientifically disprove Genesis. However, what if there really are answers to questions like:

* Can the heritage of all the people on Earth actually be traced back to a single pair of humans?

* What can the Y chromosome tell us about the biblical time-frame of Noah and our genetic heritage?

* We are told that we arose by mutations of the DNA over time, but how much time? Is time really a friend or foe?

* We are bombarded from every side with the idea of an ‘old earth’, but what can the earth tell us about its age?

* Geologists looking at the evidence tell us the earth is old, but might the same evidence tell another story, one more in keeping with the evidence?

* Can the biblical flood of Noah really hold water?

Each of these questions and many more will be answered by a geneticist, Dr. Rob Carter, population geneticist, Dr. John Sanford, and creationist geologist, Dr. Andrew Snelling, at this years Creation Summit.

Join us on February 24th and learn how science and faith do not need to be segregated, but rather the apologetic of science only goes to uphold the Bible's inerrancy.
