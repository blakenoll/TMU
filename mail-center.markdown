## We're Eager to Serve

Mail Center personnel are eager to serve the faculty, staff and students of The Master's College. While the Mail Center is not a branch of the U.S. Government, the Campus Mail Center is governed by U.S. Postal Service regulations; therefore, we must observe federal requirements in handling and processing the mail. We have also instituted other policies in order to maximize efficiency and provide a high level of service.
