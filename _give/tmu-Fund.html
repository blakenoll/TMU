<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Advancing The Master's University Highest Priority &nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">The TMU Fund is the University's unrestricted annual fund that represents an ongoing investment in the University's highest priority:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Improving student affordability for every TMU student so that we can execute our mission.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The baseline goal upon which all other ambitions are built is to make The Master’s University affordable for all students. We would like students at TMU to experience their education fully, without having to work additional jobs to cover tuition bills. We endeavor for Alumni to be able to transition to their careers when they graduate, unsaddled by debilitating sums of debt. TMU’s mission necessitates that we seriously address affordability, allowing our students and their families to focus on educational possibilities at TMU rather than a prohibitive price tag.</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>More than 90% of students at TMU rely on scholarship funds in order to attend.</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>The TMU Fund subsidizes the costs of tuition for its students.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your gift equips young men and women for spiritual service and leadership.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>In short, the TMU Fund invests in The Master's University most valuable asset - its students</strong>.</h3>
