<h1>The MacArthur Endowment</h1>
<p><strong>The MacArthur Endowment provides scholarship assistance for TMU students</strong>. The funds available each year for scholarships are allocated to the Founders’ Scholarship and Provost’s Scholarship. </p>
<p>These scholarship funds seek to impact the nations for Jesus Christ by providing financial assistance to worthy underprivileged students, minority students exhibiting leadership aptitude, and students who evidence the desire to advance the gospel worldwide. </p>
<p>The scholarship aid may be used to offset the cost of tuition, room and board, books, fees, and other expenses that otherwise qualify as educational expenses under U.S. government loan programs. Students receiving aid from the Founders’ Scholarship and Provost’s Scholarship are selected by the President and Provost, respectively.</p>
