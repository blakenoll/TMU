<p>The Master’s University Legacy Society began in 2011 to recognize supporters of the University who have committed a portion of their estate to further the vision of TMU. Since then, more than 180 friends of Master’s have joined Dr. and Mrs. John MacArthur as members of the Legacy Society. By including TMU in their estate plans, these special friends have treated the University like family. As family, members receive invitations to campus opportunities, including private events, and access to estate planning resources.</p>

<h3>Charitable Bequests</h3>
<p><strong>Adding TMU to your estate plan impacts eternity</strong></p>
<p>Through a charitable bequest, you can easily continue giving to TMU after your lifetime. A charitable bequest in your will or trust is a gift of a portion of your estate to a charity like TMU. Creating a charitable bequest is straightforward. Language can be added to your estate plan designating TMU as a beneficiary in the distribution of your estate.</p>

<h3>Gift Annuities</h3>
<p><strong>Invest in students and receive income for life</strong></p>
<p>Charitable gift annuities are a good option for donors 60 and older seeking to make a gift to The Master’s University while enjoying a steady income stream for life. A gift annuity is a simple contract between you and TMU. In exchange for your gift of cash or securities, TMU agrees to pay you a fixed amount for life. The annuity rate is based on your age. Creating a gift annuity with Master’s is easy and your first payment can begin as early as the next quarter. <a href="/alumnifriends/supporttmc/staff/">Contact</a> the Office of Development at the number below for a custom proposal that fits your needs.</p>
