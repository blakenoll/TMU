<h2 id="new-student-and-parent-faqs">New Student and Parent FAQs</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-my-tmu-">What is my TMU #?</h3>

<p>Your TMU # is your mailbox number. Mailbox numbers are issued by email during the early part of August, provided the student has completed the registration process. Information about accessing your mailbox combination will also be included in the email.</p>

<p>Your mailbox number is very important. Please notify everyone who will be sending you mail to include your mailbox number on all address labels. Mail received without your mailbox number will be delayed.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-best-way-to-ship-personal-belongings-from-home">What is the best way to ship personal belongings from home?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We recommend using UPS for your larger packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please keep packages under 50 pounds for ease in carrying them to the dorms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Packages should be corrugated with cushioning around items except clothing and books.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Packages should be firmly packed and sealed with packing tape. Do not use rope, twine, masking tape or duct tape.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Master’s College cannot assume responsibility for items stolen or damaged during shipment. Therefore, make sure all of your packages are insured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refer to the UPS website for more packaging guidelines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If packages are not prepared correctly, UPS will not honor any claims against damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A package slip will be placed in your mailbox on the day a package arrives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your packages may be picked up in the Campus Mail Center as soon as you arrive, however you may want to wait until you have checked in and have your room key, so you won’t have to carry them around.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-can-my-parents-send-me-urgent-overnight-mail">How can my parents send me urgent (overnight) mail?</h3>

<p>We recommend using Fed Ex, or UPS Next Day Air. We do not recommend using the U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail Express. The Mail Center staff signs for all Fed Ex, UPS and other accountable mail. We will put a package slip into the student’s mailbox. The student will sign for the package when he/she comes to the window to pick it up. Our policy is, “if we sign for it, you sign for it.” For other important mail that is not “urgent” (i.e., airline tickets, money order, other valuable items), we suggest using certified mail or registered mail for added security.</p>

<h3 id="where-is-the-mail-center-located">Where is the Mail Center located?</h3>

<p>The Campus Mail Center is located in the Student Center. The customer service window is located inside the Bookstore.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-mail-delivered-to-my-mailbox-each-day">When is mail delivered to my mailbox each day?</h3>

<p>Mail sorting and delivery is completed by 2:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Students are responsible to inform the Campus Mail Center of their new address if they leave the College for any reason. You may click <a href="https://www2.masters.edu/IqWeb/secure/logon.asp?TargetPage=secure%2Ftmc%2Fforwardaddress%2Fstudentf">here</a> to complete an online forwarding request. Mail is forwarded during the summer break or if a student leaves the College due to graduation, transfer or withdrawal. Mail is not forwarded during the semester (holiday) break. Mail is forwarded for a period of 12 months. The forwarding address should be updated if it changes during that period of time and students should notify all businesses, friends and family of their new address as soon as possible. Due to a USPS policy, magazines will not be forwarded. Be sure to inform magazine companies of your new address eight weeks before you move.</p>

          <h2 id="i-purpose">I. Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to establish criteria and define eligibility and restrictions in the use of The Master’s University Campus Mail Center. While the Mail Center is not a branch of the U.S. Government, we are governed by U.S. Postal regulations; therefore we must observe federal requirements in handling and processing the mail. We have also instituted other policies in order to maximize efficiency and provide a high level of service to the staff, faculty and students of The Master’s College.</p>

<h2 id="ii-general">II. General</h2>

<p>The Campus Mail Center exists primarily for the distribution, collection and processing of The Master’s University intra-campus mail and mail sent via the USPS and various express carriers. The Master’s College campus mail system is a restricted service, which is available for official business only. Official materials are those dealing with some aspect of college operations, which can be defined as essential to the activities of the institution as differentiated from private business or personal mail. It is not available for private gain or use by non-college groups for the advertisement of programs or political endorsements not sponsored by the College. However, stamps and package postage may be purchased during window hours for personal or other use.</p>

<h3 id="a-personal-mail">a. Personal Mail</h3>

<p>Personal mail is defined as any mail that is not related to TMU or your position at TMU, such as utility bills, credit card and bank accounts, periodicals not related to your position at TMU. All faculty and staff are required to receive their personal mail at home or at another permanent address. Occasional correspondence from friends and/or colleagues is acceptable. Your TMU address should never be given as your permanent address unless you live on campus. Packages received by TMU which appear to be of a personal nature will not be delivered to you. You will receive a call and will need to come and pick the package up from the Campus Mail Center.</p>

<h3 id="b-distribution-of-mail-to-students">b. Distribution of Mail to Students</h3>

<p>To reduce sorting time, please provide all mailings in ascending box number order. If every student on-campus is receiving the same information, names and box numbers are not necessary. Full sheet mailings should be tri-folded for efficient stuffing of mailboxes. Please give two days notice in order to guarantee timely delivery of a mass mailing.</p>

<h3 id="c-distribution-of-mail-to-stafffaculty">c. Distribution of Mail to Staff/Faculty</h3>

<p>To reduce sorting time, please provide all mailings in ascending box number order. Mailing directed to specific faculty or staff requires individual name and box numbers. Faculty and staff can also distribute information by sending one flyer to each department to post, sending a bundle of flyers to each department to distribute or emailing the department.</p>

<h3 id="d-forwarding-mail-policy">d. Forwarding Mail Policy</h3>

<p>Student Mail:</p>

<p>The distribution of inbound student mail is the responsibility of the TMC Campus Mail Center Supervisor. This includes the handling of mail for enrolled students on campus and forwarding the mail to students who have recently left the campus. First Class Mail is forwarded for a period of 12 months. NOTE: Magazine subscriptions will not be forwarded by the Campus Mail Center. The USPS will not accept magazines to be forwarded. If you know when you are leaving the college, notify magazine companies at least eight weeks in advance to let them know your new address. We apologize for the inconvenience.

<p>Examples of misuse of the campus mail system include the attempted distribution of chain letters, hate mail, obscene mail, letters to gain personal profit (pyramid schemes) and political endorsements.</p>

<p>While we understand that pranks are fun, the Campus Mail Center Supervisor MUST approve any pranks involving mailboxes or the Mail Center AHEAD OF TIME. Absolutely no pranks that emit any sort of odor will be allowed!</p>

<h3 id="a-enforcement">a. Enforcement</h3>

<p>Each dean, director, or department head is responsible for determining if materials to be distributed by the Campus Mail Center relate to official business of the College. When questions occur concerning such determination, the matter must be referred to the next level of college administration (dean, director, vice president, etc.). Material found within the Campus Mail Center to be in violation of this policy will be removed immediately and the appropriate administrator will be contacted.</p>

          <h2 id="i-purpose">I. Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to establish criteria and define eligibility and restrictions in the use of The Master’s University Campus Mail Center. While the Mail Center is not a branch of the U.S. Government, we are governed by U.S. Postal regulations; therefore we must observe federal requirements in handling and processing the mail. We have also instituted other policies in order to maximize efficiency and provide a high level of service to the staff, faculty and students of The Master’s College.</p>

<h2 id="ii-general">II. General</h2>

<p>The Campus Mail Center exists primarily for the distribution, collection and processing of The Master’s University intra-campus mail and mail sent via the USPS and various express carriers. The Master’s College campus mail system is a restricted service, which is available for official business only. Official materials are those dealing with some aspect of college operations, which can be defined as essential to the activities of the institution as differentiated from private business or personal mail. It is not available for private gain or use by non-college groups for the advertisement of programs or political endorsements not sponsored by the College. However, stamps and package postage may be purchased during window hours for personal or other use.</p>

<h3 id="a-personal-mail">a. Personal Mail</h3>

<p>Personal mail is defined as any mail that is not related to TMU or your position at TMU, such as utility bills, credit card and bank accounts, periodicals not related to your position at TMU. All faculty and staff are required to receive their personal mail at home or at another permanent address. Occasional correspondence from friends and/or colleagues is acceptable. Your TMU address should never be given as your permanent address unless you live on campus. Packages received by TMU which appear to be of a personal nature will not be delivered to you. You will receive a call and will need to come and pick the package up from the Campus Mail Center.</p>

<h3 id="b-distribution-of-mail-to-students">b. Distribution of Mail to Students</h3>

<p>To reduce sorting time, please provide all mailings in ascending box number order. If every student on-campus is receiving the same information, names and box numbers are not necessary. Full sheet mailings should be tri-folded for efficient stuffing of mailboxes. Please give two days notice in order to guarantee timely delivery of a mass mailing.</p>

<h3 id="c-distribution-of-mail-to-stafffaculty">c. Distribution of Mail to Staff/Faculty</h3>

<p>To reduce sorting time, please provide all mailings in ascending box number order. Mailing directed to specific faculty or staff requires individual name and box numbers. Faculty and staff can also distribute information by sending one flyer to each department to post, sending a bundle of flyers to each department to distribute or emailing the department.</p>
