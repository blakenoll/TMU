<p>A transcript is a document that reflects the completion of your secondary school education or the equivalent. Transcripts list the courses you took, the grading scale used, and the grades (marks) you obtained.</p>

<p>The Master’s University prefers that all transcripts sent to us also be accompanied by an American GPA equivalent (given on a 4.0 scale). This evaluation should be done by a credential evaluation service. If your transcript does not already give a cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale, then please have such an evaluation performed. We suggest the following two evaluators, though others are available. Look for a credential evaluation service that holds an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) membership, to ensure the highest possible accuracy in your transcript evaluation. Please follow the instructions on the evaluators’ websites.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.wes.org/" title="WES">World Education Services</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.ece.org/" title="ECE">Educational Credential Evaluators</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All transcripts must be officially translated into English, and bear both the original signature (not a photocopy) of the school official and the official school seal.</p>

<p>Transfer Students (those who have completed any post-secondary coursework) should also have their college or university transcripts submitted, likewise officially translated into English. Transfer students seeking transfer credit should make sure to have a course-by-course evaluation performed, if needing their transcripts evaluated according to paragraph 2, above.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that it may take several weeks for your school to process and mail an official transcript (in addition to the time the transcripts spend in transit, which varies from country to country). Likewise, the evaluation process may also take several days or weeks. Accordingly, please submit your transcripts requests early in the application process.</p>

<p>All official and evaluated transcripts should be sent to:</p>

<p>The Master’s University - Office of Admissions \
21726 Placerita Canyon Road \
Santa Clarita, CA 91321 \
<em>USA</em></p>

<h3 id="2-submit-english-language-test-score">2. Submit English Language Test Score</h3>

<p>Your academic success at The Master’s University depends a great deal upon your fluency in the English language. In order to determine your level of proficiency, international applicants must sit for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System).</p>

<p>The TOEFL is an official exam supervised by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service sends an official report noting your score on the exam to an institution of your choice. You may obtain information about this test at <a href="http://www.toefl.org/">www.toefl.org</a>. When you apply for the test you may have your results sent to The Master’s University by referencing our school code, which is 4411.</p>

<p>To be considered for admission to The Master’s University, applicants must earn a score of at least 80 on the internet-based (iBT) TOEFL or a 550 on paper-based version.</p>

<p>IELTS is jointly managed by the British Council, IDT:IELTS Australia, and the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Information about sitting for the IELTS can be found on their web site at <a href="http://www.ielts.org/">www.ielts.org</a>. The Master’s University requires a band score of 6.5 or higher.</p>

<p>Registration for these exams often must be secured several months in advance. Please plan accordingly.</p>

<p>Note to Native English Speakers:\
If you are a native English speaker, you should take either the SAT or ACT, in lieu of the TOEFL or IELTS. Our school code for the SAT is 4411, and for the ACT it is 0303.</p>

<p>Note to Transfer Students:\
If you have completed 24 or more semester units of transferable coursework at an accredited American university or college (but not just in an ESL program), the requirements for submitting exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, or ACT) are waived.</p>

<p>We are happy to say that—while The Master’s University is not able to give students a full scholarship—we do offer significant funds for qualified international students. We understand that this is a difficult process requiring a great deal of effort and faith. We are praying with you that God’s provision and guidance would be clear to you through this process. Currently, over 90% of our student population receives financial aid! Please note that individual awards cannot be determined until the student has been admitted to the college.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><span><h3 id="finalize-visa-requirements">Finalize Visa Requirements</h3>

<p>Most international students will need an F-1 (student) visa to study at The Master’s University. Once an international student receives his or her acceptance letter and financial aid award package, an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility may be obtained with the assistance of our Designated School Official (DSO). The I-20 can in turn be used to apply for an F-1 visa as a U.S. embassy or consulate. Of course, you as an individual are responsible for obtaining and maintaining a valid passport from your home country.</p>

<p>Before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility can be issued, the United States Department of State government requires that each international student be able to document his or her ability to afford an education at The Master’s University. Once you have received your financial aid package, you will be asked to submit documentation regarding the remainder of needed funds. This documentation can come from you the student, your family, or any number of sponsors. Each person must fill out, sign, and return the appropriate affidavit of support (see below) with a bank statement or letter from a bank official verifying the availability of funds. Again, we require these documents before we can begin to prepare your I-20, the document that will allow you to apply for an F-1 visa at an American consulate or embassy.</p>

<p>Please do not submit these forms until you have been notified to do so by the Office of International Student Advancement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additional information about obtaining and maintaining your visa and/or F-1 student status will be provided once you have been accepted to The Master’s University and have received your financial aid package. In the meantime, general information about applying for a student visa can be found on the U.S. Government’s “Study in the States” website <a href="http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/">here</a>.</p>

  <h1>Admissions - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h3>Where is The Master’s University Located?</h3>
<p>We’re tucked into a cozy canyon community about 30 minutes up the freeway from downtown L.A , the beach or Hollywood!</p>
<h3>When can I visit the school?</h3>
<p>That’s a great question because there are so many choices. First off, you should know that our doors are always open. Drop in whenever you want. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are great because that’s when we hold chapel services, but you can experience our heart for the Lord any day of the week. If you’re up for a more structured event, we hold College View Weekends twice a year. You can also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/visit/personalized-visit/" title="Personalized Visit">schedule a personalized tour</a> with a few mouse clicks.</p>
<h3>What are the TMU school codes?</h3>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FAFSA School Code: 001220</li>
<li>SAT School Code: 4411</li>
<li>ACT Code: 0303</li>
</ul>
<h3>What kind of financial aid is offered at TMU?</h3>
<p>The important thing to know here is that a TMU education is a LOT more affordable than you think. We offer federal, state, institutional aid in the form of grants, loans, need based and merit based scholarships, and work study programs. Most of our students (93% at last count) receive some form of financial – why not you? The average TMU student receives over $20,000 in financial aid each year. Just make sure to get your application in early and to submit your FAFSA!</p>
<h3>How much will TMU cost for&nbsp;<span>me personally</span>?</h3>
<p>Great question! Seeing how everyone’s financial situation is different, we recommend using our Total Price Calculator. To access our Total Price Calculator,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/financial-aid/total-cost-calculator/" target="blank" title="Total Cost Calculator">click here</a>.</p>
<h3>How many programs do we offer?</h3>
<p>This answer surprises people because they think we only offer Bible classes. The truth is we are a liberal arts college built on a biblical foundation, and that means variety. We offer 13 majors and over 55 areas of study.</p>
<h3>What are the top 6 majors?</h3>
<p>Hmmm … that’s a tough question. We think all of our majors are great. But if we must rank them, our most attended are: Business, Biology, Communication, Bible, and Music.</p>
<h3>Will my credits transfer from________________?</h3>
<p>We get this one a lot. The answer depends on a few factors: Namely, where are the credits coming from (the college must be accredited) and what kind of grades did you earn (nothing below a C is accepted). And yes, we do accept CLEP, AP, and IB credits. Check out our articulation agreements with CA schools at <a href="/articulation" title="here">www.masters.edu/articulation</a></p>
<h3>How many units do I need to be considered a transfer student?</h3>
<p>The magic number here is 24 semester units (36 quarter units), and those need to be credits that you completed after high school graduation.&nbsp;But don’t sweat it. If you have less than 24 units, we’ll just go off your high school transcript and test scores.</p>
<h3>What is the average class size at TMU?</h3>
<p>We love this question because it highlights one of our best features: personal attention. Our lower division classes range from 30-40 students, and our upper division classes are limited to about 8-15. Some Bible classes are bigger (close to 100 students), but over the past four years, our average class size is 20-25 students. That’s a great environment in which too engage your professors – and for them to engage you!</p>
<h3>What is the student/teacher ratio?</h3>
<p>The ratio is 10-to-1. In other words, you will get to know your profs. And they will get to invest in you.</p>
<h3>What classes should I take if I am transferring to TMU from a community college?</h3>
<p>The first place to look for answers to this one is in our <a href="http://www.masters.edu/catalog">Academic Catalog</a> – lots of helpful specifics there. After that, you should talk to one of our <a href="http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/bios/" title="Bios">counselors </a>(they’re extremely helpful and they speak in plain English) or go straight to the Registrar’s Office – the buck stops there. You’ll be glad to know we have <a href="http://www.masters.edu/articulation">articulation agreements</a> with most community colleges in California, Oregon, Washington, and some in Arizona. We’ll contact them for you and help you sort it all out.</p>
<h3>What kind of rules does TMU have?</h3>
<p>The most important rule you need to know about is also the rule that’s most important to us: we call it the Rule of Grace. It governs the rest of them, so we’ll start there. After that, we have a small handful of parameters (recently revised). Check out the&nbsp;<a href="/handbook" target="_blank">Student Handbook</a> for the details.</p>
<h3>Is chapel required?</h3>
<p>Chapel is the hub of the TMU community and attendance is required. Chapel meets three times per week and students can miss up to six per semester.</p>
<h3>What sports are offered at TMU?</h3>
<p>You'll find Mustangs competing on the following teams:</p>
<p><strong>MEN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Basketball</li>
<li>Baseball</li>
<li>Soccer</li>
<li>X-Country</li>
<li>Track</li>
<li>Golf</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WOMEN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Basketball</li>
<li>Soccer</li>
<li>X-Country</li>
<li>Track</li>
<li>Volleyball</li>
</ul>
<p>We also offer a fierce (and fun) menu of intramural sports: Basketball, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, Softball, Golf, Tennis, Flag Football, Soccer, Dodge Ball.</p>
<p>Pack your cleats.</p>
<h3>What is the male/female ratio at TMU?</h3>
<p>While many Christian colleges operate on a female/male ratio of two or even three to one, we’ve got a level playing field here. Translation: our guy-to-gal ratio is 1-to-1. Sorry, guys.</p>
<h3>Can I bring a car to school?</h3>
<p>Remember, this is L.A. Of course you can bring a car (but you can get by without it). Just pack an extra $45 per semester to cover the parking fee. And make sure to read the parking signs!</p>
<h3>Are there any restrictions on having a car at TMU?</h3>
<p>A few. The first is obvious – make sure your car is properly registered and adequately insured (the state of California came up with that one). You should also know that you can’t just park anywhere. But you do have dorm parking. Finally, for you do-it-yourselfers, make sure you get permission before you decide to throw your car up on blocks and change out the transmission in front of Hotchkiss Hall.</p>
<h3>Is our campus secure?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Our students are our most precious commodity, and we take our stewardship of them seriously. We are situated in a quiet, safe neighborhood, but we take nothing for granted. Our campus security officers patrol the campus 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our annual crime report speaks for itself--find a copy <a href="http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/campussafety.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I live off campus?</h3>
<p>What? And miss all the perks of campus life? If you must, there are some restrictions. Full-time students can live off campus, if they're over the age of 21 and have come in as freshmen or are married. Some students live off campus (usually with Mom and Dad) and commute. But most prefer the TMU community. You can check out the Student Handbook for more specifics.</p>
<h3>What are TMU’s admission requirements?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior</li>
<li>High school graduate, GED, or California High School Proficiency Exam</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Pastor Recommendation</li>
<li>Personal Statements</li>
<li>SAT/ACT Scores</li>
<li>High school and or college transcripts</li>
<li>Application Fee: $40 (waived during Early Action)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Early Action Deadline:</strong> Your application must be postmarked by November 15, although financial aid applications can come later. We’ll let you know if you’ve been accepted within 2-3 weeks of receiving your completed application.</p>
<p><strong>Priority Deadline:</strong> March 2nd. However, we continue to asked applications on a "rolling" basis even after our Priority Deadline.</p>
<h3>Do I qualify for financial aid?</h3>
<p>Let’s put it this way, if you don’t, you’re in the minority … way in the minority. About 93% of our students qualify for financial aid.</p>
<h3>Does TMU prefer the SAT or ACT?</h3>
<p>Take your pick. Either one works for us. But if you take the SAT, make sure it’s the SAT I because we don’t use the SAT II.</p>
<h3>What are academic guidelines for GPA and test scores?</h3>
<p>There are a number of factors, so we don't publish specific minimums. We're looking for students who have succeeded in college preparatory high school classes, and have earned above average test scores on the SAT or ACT. If a student falls below the recommended test score or grade point average, the student could still be admitted as part of our Program for Academic Support and Success (PASS).</p>
<h3>What denomination is TMU?</h3>
<p>We believe the Bible is literally true and divinely inspired. If that’s a denomination, then that’s us. Other than that we are non-denominational.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/abouttmc/doctrine/" target="_blank" title="Doctrine">Click here</a> to read over our doctrinal statement.</p>
<h3>What percentage of the faculty uphold and affirm the TMU doctrinal statement?</h3>
<p>Is this a trick question? We hold firm to our doctrinal statement and so does our faculty — all of our faculty … 100%.</p>
<h3>How many countries are represented at TMU?</h3>
<p>It may be easier to answer this one by telling you which countries aren’t represented. Right now, our student body looks like an international shepherd’s pie. We have students from 30 countries.</p>
<h3>I’m from one of those other countries… how do I apply to TMU?</h3>
<p>Check out our step-by-step guide for International Students&nbsp;<a href="http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/international" title="International Applicants">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Is TMU accredited?</h3>
<p>We love this question because we’re not only accredited, we’re WASC accredited (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) and a member ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International) and other associations. That’s a lot of letters, and they all add up to one thing: TMU is a seriously decorated, seriously recognized academic institution.</p>
<h3>What can I do with my TMU degree?</h3>
<p>What can’t you do with it? Build an economic empire, write the great American novel, cure the common cold. A TMU education will help you find God’s plan for your career … God’s unique and perfect use for your unique and perfect array of gifts. Can’t beat that.</p>
<h3>Do TMU graduates attend Graduate School?</h3>
<p>Yes. Our graduates continue their educations at such institutions as Pepperdine, UCLA, Georgetown, Oxford, Duke, and USC. Twenty percent of TMU students attend immediately and 35% attend within five years. Medical schools attended by TMU grads include Baylor College of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Loma Linda University, University of Michigan, and College of Osteopathic Medicine. About 95% of our students who apply to med school get in. Seminaries: TMU grads have attended Western Conservative Baptist, Talbot School of Theology, Dallas Theological Seminary, The Master’s Seminary, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.</p>
<h3>How many home school students attend Master’s?</h3>
<p>Home school students constitute about a third of our student body, so we’ve got a nice mix. The other 2/3rds are split between public and private high school.</p>
<h3>What is there to do for fun?</h3>
<p>We can answer that question with two words in Spanish: Los Angeles. Being 30 minutes from the heart of L.A. means you are 30 minutes from (you can fill in the blank here). Want sun? How about a quick drive to Santa Monica or Malibu Beach? Like to shop? We’ve got a fantastic mall here in town, or you can always zip down the Hollywood freeway to Beverly Hills or Melrose Avenue. Like museums? The Getty is close and it’s free. How about a trip to Hollywoood, Disneyland, or Six Flags (which is right here in Santa Clarita)? You won’t ever be bored. Just don’t forget about your homework!</p>
<h3>Do students stay on campus all weekend?</h3>
<p>Even with everything Los Angeles has to offer, our students also enjoy just hanging out together on campus. Between dorm life, intramurals, sporting events, plays, concerts, or just kicking back at the Mustang Grill, there’s always plenty to do. Just make sure not to park your car next to Reese Field during a baseball game. Watching foul balls bounce off of windshields is another weekend pastime our students enjoy every spring.</p>
<h3>How many dorms do you have on campus and are they co-ed?</h3>
<p>We have 8 dorms on campus.&nbsp;<br />All-girl dorms –&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/residence-life/dorm-life/sweazy-hall.aspx">Sweazy</a> and&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/residence-life/dorm-life/dixon-hall.aspx">Dixon</a> Halls&nbsp;<br />All-guy dorms –&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/residence-life/dorm-life/slight-hall.aspx">Slight</a> and&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/residence-life/dorm-life/waldock-hall.aspx">Waldock</a> Halls<br />“Split” dorms (<span>guys’ halls separated from girls’ halls by a common lounge area</span>) –&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/residence-life/dorm-life/hotchkiss-hall.aspx">Hotchkiss</a> and&nbsp;<a href="/student-life/residence-life/dorm-life/smith-hall.aspx">Smith</a> Halls&nbsp;<br />For more information about dorm life check out our&nbsp;<a href="/student-life.aspx">student life page</a>.</p>
