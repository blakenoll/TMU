    "title": "Senior Memoir: Kailey Richardson",
    "text": "Master’s was my last choice. Not only was it my last choice, but it was the only choice I tried to run away from. I have been around this school my entire life. I was born and raised in the Santa Clarita Valley. I grew up going to Placerita Bible Church, which is next to Masters, for the first seventeen years of my life. My parents were involved in the college group, my dad is an adjunct professor at Master’s, my mom would eventually work here for a period of time, and both my siblings went to the college. I cannot remember a time that I didn’t know of Master’s. It always seemed like an option to go here. Then, my sophomore year of high school, I lost my mom to cancer. It was then I began chasing the wrong things for comfort. When it came time to choose a college, I was determined to get away from the school so familiar to me. I gave plenty of reasons but the truth was I didn’t want the spiritual accountability. As the Lord had it, all my attempts to go to a different school utterly failed. So August 17, 2013, I reluctantly came to WOW (Week of Welcome) Saturday, with every intention to transfer as soon as possible. The transition was rough. I faked my way to fit in and my heart was at war with itself. Then, one night, I had a conversation with my Resident Assistant (RA) that permanently changed my life. We chatted and gave bits of our life stories before eventually sharing our full testimonies with one another. Towards the end, she told me she had been praying for me the past two years. She had gone to Outreach Week with my brother back in 2011 and he had given a prayer request for me. She was faithful to fulfill that request. What? I was stunned, thrown off guard and absolutely bewildered. Here was a girl, whom I had never met, who had been praying for me for two years. There was nothing I had ever been faithful enough to pray about for two whole years. She didn’t know if she would ever meet me, let alone that I would end up on her wing. And, yet, she petitioned the Lord on my behalf. It was a gracious smack in the face. God had me here, exactly where I was, on that exact wing, in that exact dorm for a reason. Why was I fighting? If I was simply willing to let go, trust and submit, there would be so much the Lord could do. God broke me that night. It was a turning point. Since then, my life has been radically different. I have been involved in the Theatre Arts program at Master’s from that first semester on. I built solid friendships that I still have today. My sophomore year I went through the Israel Bible Extension program (IBEX) and spent three months studying in the Holy Land. My junior year I became an RA. My senior year, as an RA again, I have had the privilege of serving under Resident Director Annelise Wright. She is that same person who was my RA freshman year. In total, some of the sweetest moments have been created here. In looking back, the temptation would be to say that it has all been rainbows and sunshine and The Master’s University is the best place on earth. It’s not. Some semesters have been brutal. They have presented some of the hardest trials I’ve ever gone through. I have lived around and gone to school with about 1,000 other fallen beings. I have sinned and been sinned against. Master’s, as shocking as it may be, is not perfect. Yet, the Lord has used this university in amazing ways. I have been given the foundational understanding of what it is to be a believer. In spite of my selfish desires, times of idolatry and impatience with fellow believers, God has worked. He has taught me who He is through the work of His Spirit in my life. He has shown me the preciousness of His Word. He has displayed the importance of the church. He has revealed my dire need for absolute dependence on Him. He has kept His treasure in this jar of clay so that His surpassing power would only be attributed to Him and never to me. My prayer for the school is that it would keep Christ at the center, as it has already done for 90 years. That it would be focused on how we are presenting the gospel, both to the world and to each other. I pray this school would be unified, under the sole basis of the gospel, no matter the dorm, state of origin, race, gender, sport, upbringing, etc. For if we have the gospel in common, we have everything in common. For His glory, and His glory alone.",

    "title": "TMU Students Present Research at Nationally Recognized Science Conference",
    "text": "“Research is the undergirding of science… It is a publish or perish field,” said Dr. Joe Francis, chair of The Master’s University Department of Biological and Physical Sciences. This well-known fact among the science community is the driving force behind the Annual West Coast Biological Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference (WCBSURC for short) held April 22, 2017. One of the oldest conferences of its kind, its purpose is to “provide a forum for undergraduate researchers to present original data they have generated in the fields of biology and biochemistry” (italics added) while fostering intercollegiate interaction among students and faculty. In its 42 years, this conference has brought together participants from 182 institutions in 36 states. This year was the eighth time that students from The Master’s University have presented their own research alongside students from other reputable schools like the University of Southern California, Tulane University, Loyola Marymount University, Arizona State University, Vanguard University and many, many more. “We want to help [our students] develop the ability to present their research at a high level and to network,” said Dr. Matt Ingle, a project supervisor and Master’s U professor specializing in parasitology. “For any student going into graduate school, the way to be successful is to have your network as broad as possible. As a grad student you don’t need to have deep relationships, as your research is your own, but you do need to rely on other research to explore your own questions.” After traveling over 6 hours to get to Santa Clara University, four student groups defended their answers to the questions they have been researching for over three months. The projects included: “Quality of Mule Deer Fragmented Habitat in Towsley Canyon of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in Santa Clarita, California” Students: Jack Underwood, Ethan Brandt, Ethan Cherry, Abby Televera, Shelly Cruzan, Nellie Covert Supervising Professor: Dr. Dennis Englin “Cold-Case Paleobiology: Investigation of a Pathological Ptersoaur Bone from the Morrison Formation of Colorado” Student: Kelly Whitely Supervising Professor: Dr. Matt McLain “Reduction in Intermediate Host Performance After Infection with Hymenolepis Diminuta” Students: Keifer Bronstedt, Emily Curtain, James Gilbert and Bethany Brown Supervising Professor: Dr. Matt Ingle “Analysis of the Attack of a Single Wind-Thrown Pine Tree in a Healthy Montane Forest by Several Species of Pine Bark Beetles” Student: Bekah Johnson Supervising Professor: Dr. Joe Francis Having done over 26 hours of research on pine bark beetles, Bekah Johnson, who hopes to be an entomologist one day, expressed how “small, intricate and elaborate (the bugs) are. It is so impressive—the Lord’s work in creating these tiny and sometimes large insects. I love studying these intricacies and how they interact in the world around them.” Her project analyzes the arrival of different beetle species—before and after a pine tree has fallen. Kelly Whitely, who worked under TMU’s resident paleontologist Dr. Matt McLain, explained her project: “(it) combines diagnostics, mystery-solving, and flying reptiles—how much more interesting could it get?” Having thoroughly enjoyed the novelty of researching pathologies on an extinct creature, she was excited to share what she had learned. “…regardless of the amount of research you do,” she said, “there is always the possibility of getting several questions you don’t know the answer to—the thought of not having an answer makes me nervous.” But that nervousness and feeling of inadequacy is exactly what Dr. Francis hoped would come of this research class and attendance at the conference. “…undergraduate education is still a one-way communication system: teacher to student,” he said. “There are advantages to that but having that research experience shows (to grad schools) a student who is presented with a problem and has to solve it on their own. We (faculty) can’t tell you everything about it because that’s the nature of research; you’re supposed to discover something new.” However, many undergraduate programs do not have the ability to allow students to conduct research, as they lack the capacity to host them. Scientific research in college requires faculty supervision and many larger schools do not have enough faculty to support the numerous student groups. As most graduate institutions strongly recommend research experience, the lack thereof becomes a detriment when undergraduates begin pursuing graduate studies. This is not the case at The Master’s University. With a course specifically set aside for individual or group research supported by a faculty member, TMU students are given the freedom to plan and structure their research. Funded by The Centers of Excellence—a new program dedicated to investing and developing core academic areas—and the Shamrock Foundation, students are given the responsibility to budget their research and compile and complete the study of their choosing. Their formal presentations at WCBSURC add to and challenge the ongoing dialogue in the world of science. Consistently, the Biological and Physical Sciences Department receives letters from alumni in graduate programs thanking them for their experience at WCBSURC, saying it was the first time they really understood what critical thinking was because their research was so individualized, not based off of a book or an instruction manual. It paved the way for their medical or graduate school career and, ultimately, their future.",

    "title": "Dr. John Stead Named TMU Provost",
    "text": "SANTA CLARITA, CA — The Master’s University is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. John Stead to the position of Senior Vice President and Provost. With a doctorate from the University of Southern California in the triumvirate of American politics, political theory and comparative politics, Stead has taught at Master’s U as a professor of history and political studies for 47 years, serving as the Vice President for Academic Affairs for over 21 of those years. University President John MacArthur is “thankful to have John (Stead) move into this role that he is so highly qualified to fill due to his education, history at the university and long-standing commitment to Christ. He is a highly respected educator in the echelons of academia, as well as a favorite of the students with his wisdom and personal interest in their lives.” Stead is looking forward to working alongside MacArthur, his life-long friend. A witness to much of the university’s history, he remembers the first accreditation in 1975, MacArthur’s inauguration as president when Los Angeles Baptist College became The Master’s College in 1985, and then the institution’s transition to The Master’s University this past year. “The challenge of continually supporting and strengthening of our faculty and staff, and most importantly, upholding the gospel as the sure foundation of the university is my foremost commitment,” said Stead, speaking to his new role. “Ultimately, there is no university without our beloved students. They are what drives me to help make this a place that honors the gospel by giving them the opportunity for a Christ-centered education, equipping them with a Christian worldview and preparing them to serve in the church, workplace and home.” This new role for Dr. Stead follows the recent announcement by the university’s Executive Vice President, Dr. Lee Duncan that he will be leaving at the end of this school year to move back into the world of accreditation. Dr. Duncan recently wrote, “I miss being out in Christian schools and teaching them how to use the accreditation process to improve what they are doing. Therefore, after much prayer, I have made the difficult decision to leave TMU to take an opportunity with the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI).” While excited to welcome Dr. Stead as our Provost we are grateful for the leadership and faithfulness of Dr. Duncan during his years at Master’s U. The university will continue to flourish under the leadership of one of its most-loved professors and administrators. Eager to continue serving the faculty, staff and students, Stead will assume this new role following TMU’s 90th Commencement Ceremony on May 5, 2017.",

    "title": "Stumbling Across the Gospel in the Jungle",
    "text": "Article By: Nathan Parsons (Class of 2018) Photos By: Mark Finster (Class of 2017) On Jan. 3, 1956, five evangelical missionaries began to set up camp on Palm Beach, an isolated sandbar on the Curaray river in Ecuador. Shouting basic Waodaniphrases into the jungle, Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming and Roger Youderian were determined to bring the gospel to this unreached Ecuadorian tribe. Around 3:00 p.m. on Jan. 8, six Waodanitribesmen emerged from the jungle, gesturing to the missionaries. By 3:30 p.m., the bodies of all five men lay strewn across the sand, brutally speared to death. ***** A few weeks ago, Mark Finster, Mitch Clevidence and I boarded a plane at LAX and flew to Ecuador for our TMU spring break. We planned to rent a car, drive around, shoot video for our video journalism class, eat local food and avoid suffering from altitude sickness. We did all those things, save avoiding the altitude sickness (sorry, Mark). We experienced the predictably unpredictable mishaps that go along with three 20-somethings driving around South America, including taking the “scenic route” that left us with our car stuck in the mud. If Juan and Juan Carlos hadn’t shown up with their 4x4 to pull us out, we’d probably still be there. Before leaving for our trip, we talked through the story of the five missionaries martyred on Palm Beach. When Life magazine published a 10-page article on their mission to reach the Waodaniand their deaths in 1956, their martyrdom quickly gripped the fascination of American evangelicalism and continues to do so today. Between reading Nate Saint’s biography four times and watching “End of the Spear”(2006) more than one should, it’s safe to say their story saturated my childhood. With their stories in the back of our minds, we made sure to schedule a stop in Shell. Named after the British oil company, Shell served as the home base for the missionaries’ operations. Nate Saint’s (refurbished) house still stands not more than 500 yards away from the airstrip he used fly his yellow Piper Cub into the jungle. Driving by the airstrip was meaningful; barreling down the runway in a six-seat bush plane was another thing entirely. Thanks to the connections of some missionaries Mark knows, less than a day after arriving in Shell we found ourselves flying out to the Waodanivillage of Tiweano. As I looked down at the mountainous, jagged jungle terrain, I understood why Tiweano remains unconnected by road. Warm Waodanitribespeople and stifling humidity met us when we landed on the grass airstrip in Tiweano. Mincayeand Mineawa—two Waodanimen who flew out with us and graciously acted as our guides—helped the pilot reposition the plane and led us to the village’s church building. When the five missionaries died on Palm Beach, their mission did not end; it signaled the beginning. A few years later, Elizabeth Elliot (Jim’s widow) and Rachel Saint (Nate’s sister) successfully made peaceful contact with the Waodani, eventually living with them and evangelizing. The forgiveness shown by Elizabeth and Rachel stood in sharp contrast to the revenge killings previously intrinsic to Waodaniculture and resulted in many tribespeople coming to Christ. Culturally accepted murder ceased almost immediately. Churches sprang up within the tribe, and some of the men who murdered the missionaries in 1956 became church elders. One of these men, Dyuwi, was more than happy to speak with us. “It gives me great joy that when I die, I will go to heaven,” said Dyuwi, now 82. “Jesus saved me and will not let me go.” Speaking in Waodanithrough a translator, Dyuwi’s eyes lit up when asked about what continues to drive him. “I have a great passion for this third generation of Waodani…to know Christ. I fear that when they go outside the tribe, they fall away and turn towards the temptations of the world.” Still in a subtle state of shock after having the opportunity to talk to Dyuwi, we reboarded our prop plane for the 10-minute flight to the village of Tunempadi. After landing and disembarking, Mincaye and Mineawa led us down a dirt path towards the shore of the Curaray river. We emerged from the path within one hundred yards of “the spot.” The constant flow of the Curaray has since eroded the specific sand bar that made up the original Palm Beach, but the spot has not been forgotten. Since I’ve returned from Ecuador, a lot of people have asked me “what it was like” to stand where those five missionaries died. To be sure, I felt a sense of history and solemnness. But in the end, it’s just a beach in the middle of the jungle. While I stood on the beach and looked at Mark, Mitch and three Christian Waodani, I realized the story lies in the present, not the past. Or, more to the point, the story demonstrates the gospel’s power to transform individual lives and cultures. As American Christians lament Western society’s increasing secularism, it is easy to become fatalistic and forget that the gospel comes not “in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit” (1 Thess. 1:5). It can transform an isolated, fear-driven tribal society, where 70 percent of men could expect to be murdered at some point, to one that stands as a spiritual leader among Ecuadorian tribes, all within a few decades. The gospel transforms lives so dramatically that Dyuwi—a murderer of the men who brought the faith he now follows—can look Mark square in the face and joyfully tell him that because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, he is forgiven in the eyes of God. As we flew back to Los Angeles, I could not help but think of 2 Corinthians 5:17, where the Apostle Paul—a murderer himself—tells the previously pagan Corinthians that “if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new is come.” Whether in the jungles of Ecuador or on the campus of The Master’s University, the gospel has the same effect: it convicts, saves and transforms, regardless of human effort. Before leaving for spring break, Mark, Mitch and I figured we’d experience Ecuador’s splendor, whether that came in the natural landscapes, the people or the food. None of that, however, compared with the beauty of the gospel.",

    "text": "Deciding where to go to college is one of the most important choices we make in life. Wanting to be successful—which looks different for everyone—can be a driving factor in choosing a school. For the first time we are on our own, every decision impacting the person we will become. As a high school athlete, it was so easy for me to get caught up in the ambition to play for a Division I school. I believed I would be defined by what college or division I played in, and it was a major factor in my choice: “Do I really want to go play baseball for this tiny NAIA school? What would my friends think? What would my high school coach think?” In retrospect, I know I could not have answered these questions without the influence of my brother, Steven. The Lord divinely placed him at The Master’s University two years before me and opened up a door that would change me in many ways. I saw firsthand what TMU had done for my brother academically, athletically and spiritually. So, choosing TMU myself became an easy decision. I saw how Master’s played an active role in molding him into the man of God that he is, I watched how all his like-minded friends pushed him to be like Christ and I noticed the success he was having playing baseball while having fun and still pursuing excellence in the classroom. His experience was exactly what I wanted, and I knew I could not get that anywhere but Master’s. I could not play for a better coach or with better teammates, athletes who love the Lord and still have the passion and desire to win games. I get to play for a coach that pushes me on the field and, more importantly, pushes us all to do everything for the glory of God. Coach Monte Brooks has been one of the greatest blessings of my life, exhorting all of us to “love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37). This is our team verse and Coach has used it to teach us that we must become slaves to Christ if we want to be excellent and successful in all that we do as Christians. The baseball team has opened one of the largest doors to my spiritual growth. On this team I have been tested and established lifelong friendships with guys focused on Christ. If I had chosen another school, I would have missed out on my two favorite memories as a Mustang: throwing a perfect game with my brother playing in the outfield and being a part of a team that reached the World Series. I am beyond grateful that the Lord’s plan for me included attending and playing baseball here. This university has completely shattered the roof of my expectations and has influenced my life more than I could have imagined, all by the grace of God. I am forever thankful for The Master’s University.",

    "title": "Welcome to Jekyll!",
    "text": "“I want to mimic what Jake [Litwin] said on Monday and thank the Bible Department for allowing me to have this opportunity,” said Nate Youtzy, his deep voice booming as he opened his Spurgeonfest sermon. According to Pastor John Piper, Charles H. Spurgeon is “considered by many to be one of the greatest preachers since the days of the apostles,” having preached over 600 times before the age of 20. Named in reference to this famous and very quotable preacher, Spurgeonfest is a week that has been set aside annually since the early 1990s to enable senior Bible majors at The Master’s University the opportunity to preach in chapel. The Biblical Studies Department along with the leadership of Student Life “thought it would be a good idea to have a few senior Bible Majors preach. They do a similar thing at the seminary and we thought we would do the same,” explained Dr. Tom Halstead, chair of the Biblical Studies Department. Nominated and selected by the Bible faculty based on their achievement in the Sermon Preparation course, reputation in the department and credibility around campus, students consider it quite an honor to speak to their peers and represent the department. The two speakers selected this year? Jake Litwin and Nate Youtzy. Litwin, a resident assistant in C.W. Smith Hall, spoke Monday using 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 as his text, reminding himself and his audience to not follow the world’s wisdom but be confident in the wisdom of God and His saving gospel. “Our boasting is in Christ alone,” he said, “because He gives us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption.” Youtzy, having been guided by his own time in the Word, spoke from Matthew 16:24-28 describing what it looks like to be a disciple of God. Nate plans on continuing his education at The Master’s Seminary this fall. Both students were encouraged by the eruption of applause and affirmation from their peers as the sermons ended. They did “an equally fabulous job,” according to Halstead, who continued, “I am so proud of them and thought it couldn’t have been better. That just shows the time and work of our faculty as well. Jake and Nate were good examples for us this year.”",

Our staff is here to guide you through this process—you’re not on your own! Please contact Amy Bryerton, International Admissions Counselor, with any additional questions you have about international financial aid. Step 4 Finalize Visa Requirements Most international students will need an F-1 (student) visa to study at The Master’s University. Once an international student receives his or her acceptance letter and financial aid award package, an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility may be obtained with the assistance of our Designated School Official (DSO). The I-20 can in turn be used to apply for an F-1 visa as a U.S. embassy or consulate. Of course, you as an individual are responsible for obtaining and maintaining a valid passport from your home country. Before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility can be issued, the United States Department of State government requires that each international student be able to document his or her ability to afford an education at The Master’s University. Once you have received your financial aid package, you will be asked to submit documentation regarding the remainder of needed funds. This documentation can come from you the student, your family, or any number of sponsors. Each person must fill out, sign, and return the appropriate affidavit of support (see below) with a bank statement or letter from a bank official verifying the availability of funds. Again, we require these documents before we can begin to prepare your I-20, the document that will allow you to apply for an F-1 visa at an American consulate or embassy. Please do not submit these forms until you have been notified to do so by the Office of International Student Advancement: Student/Parent Affidavit of Support Form Sponsor Affidavit of Support Form Additional information about obtaining and maintaining your visa and/or F-1 student status will be provided once you have been accepted to The Master’s University and have received your financial aid package. In the meantime, general information about applying for a student visa can be found on the U.S. Government’s “Study in the States” website here. Admissions - Frequently Asked Questions Where is The Master’s University Located? We’re tucked into a cozy canyon community about 30 minutes up the freeway from downtown L.A , the beach or Hollywood! When can I visit the school? That’s a great question because there are so many choices. First off, you should know that our doors are always open. Drop in whenever you want. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are great because that’s when we hold chapel services, but you can experience our heart for the Lord any day of the week. If you’re up for a more structured event, we hold College View Weekends twice a year. You can also&nbsp;schedule a personalized tour with a few mouse clicks. What are the TMU school codes? They are: FAFSA School Code: 001220 SAT School Code: 4411 ACT Code: 0303 What kind of financial aid is offered at TMU? The important thing to know here is that a TMU education is a LOT more affordable than you think. We offer federal, state, institutional aid in the form of grants, loans, need based and merit based scholarships, and work study programs. Most of our students (93% at last count) receive some form of financial – why not you? The average TMU student receives over $20,000 in financial aid each year. Just make sure to get your application in early and to submit your FAFSA! How much will TMU cost for&nbsp;me personally? Great question! Seeing how everyone’s financial situation is different, we recommend using our Total Price Calculator. To access our Total Price Calculator,&nbsp;click here. How many programs do we offer? This answer surprises people because they think we only offer Bible classes. The truth is we are a liberal arts college built on a biblical foundation, and that means variety. We offer 13 majors and over 55 areas of study. What are the top 6 majors? Hmmm … that’s a tough question. We think all of our majors are great. But if we must rank them, our most attended are: Business, Biology, Communication, Bible, and Music. Will my credits transfer from________________? We get this one a lot. The answer depends on a few factors: Namely, where are the credits coming from (the college must be accredited) and what kind of grades did you earn (nothing below a C is accepted). And yes, we do accept CLEP, AP, and IB credits. Check out our articulation agreements with CA schools at www.masters.edu/articulation How many units do I need to be considered a transfer student? The magic number here is 24 semester units (36 quarter units), and those need to be credits that you completed after high school graduation.&nbsp;But don’t sweat it. If you have less than 24 units, we’ll just go off your high school transcript and test scores. What is the average class size at TMU? We love this question because it highlights one of our best features: personal attention. Our lower division classes range from 30-40 students, and our upper division classes are limited to about 8-15. Some Bible classes are bigger (close to 100 students), but over the past four years, our average class size is 20-25 students. That’s a great environment in which too engage your professors – and for them to engage you! What is the student/teacher ratio? The ratio is 10-to-1. In other words, you will get to know your profs. And they will get to invest in you. What classes should I take if I am transferring to TMU from a community college? The first place to look for answers to this one is in our Academic Catalog – lots of helpful specifics there. After that, you should talk to one of our counselors (they’re extremely helpful and they speak in plain English) or go straight to the Registrar’s Office – the buck stops there. You’ll be glad to know we have articulation agreements with most community colleges in California, Oregon, Washington, and some in Arizona. We’ll contact them for you and help you sort it all out. What kind of rules does TMU have? The most important rule you need to know about is also the rule that’s most important to us: we call it the Rule of Grace. It governs the rest of them, so we’ll start there. After that, we have a small handful of parameters (recently revised). Check out the&nbsp;Student Handbook for the details. Is chapel required? Chapel is the hub of the TMU community and attendance is required. Chapel meets three times per week and students can miss up to six per semester. What sports are offered at TMU? You'll find Mustangs competing on the following teams: MEN Basketball Baseball Soccer X-Country Track Golf WOMEN Basketball Soccer X-Country Track Volleyball We also offer a fierce (and fun) menu of intramural sports: Basketball, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, Softball, Golf, Tennis, Flag Football, Soccer, Dodge Ball. Pack your cleats. What is the male/female ratio at TMU? While many Christian colleges operate on a female/male ratio of two or even three to one, we’ve got a level playing field here. Translation: our guy-to-gal ratio is 1-to-1. Sorry, guys. Can I bring a car to school? Remember, this is L.A. Of course you can bring a car (but you can get by without it). Just pack an extra $45 per semester to cover the parking fee. And make sure to read the parking signs! Are there any restrictions on having a car at TMU? A few. The first is obvious – make sure your car is properly registered and adequately insured (the state of California came up with that one). You should also know that you can’t just park anywhere. But you do have dorm parking. Finally, for you do-it-yourselfers, make sure you get permission before you decide to throw your car up on blocks and change out the transmission in front of Hotchkiss Hall. Is our campus secure? Absolutely. Our students are our most precious commodity, and we take our stewardship of them seriously. We are situated in a quiet, safe neighborhood, but we take nothing for granted. Our campus security officers patrol the campus 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our annual crime report speaks for itself--find a copy here. Can I live off campus? What? And miss all the perks of campus life? If you must, there are some restrictions. Full-time students can live off campus, if they're over the age of 21 and have come in as freshmen or are married. Some students live off campus (usually with Mom and Dad) and commute. But most prefer the TMU community. You can check out the Student Handbook for more specifics. What are TMU’s admission requirements? Faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior High school graduate, GED, or California High School Proficiency Exam Application Pastor Recommendation Personal Statements SAT/ACT Scores High school and or college transcripts Application Fee: $40 (waived during Early Action) Early Action Deadline: Your application must be postmarked by November 15, although financial aid applications can come later. We’ll let you know if you’ve been accepted within 2-3 weeks of receiving your completed application. Priority Deadline: March 2nd. However, we continue to asked applications on a \"rolling\" basis even after our Priority Deadline. Do I qualify for financial aid? Let’s put it this way, if you don’t, you’re in the minority … way in the minority. About 93% of our students qualify for financial aid. Does TMU prefer the SAT or ACT? Take your pick. Either one works for us. But if you take the SAT, make sure it’s the SAT I because we don’t use the SAT II. What are academic guidelines for GPA and test scores? There are a number of factors, so we don't publish specific minimums. We're looking for students who have succeeded in college preparatory high school classes, and have earned above average test scores on the SAT or ACT. If a student falls below the recommended test score or grade point average, the student could still be admitted as part of our Program for Academic Support and Success (PASS). What denomination is TMU? We believe the Bible is literally true and divinely inspired. If that’s a denomination, then that’s us. Other than that we are non-denominational.&nbsp;Click here to read over our doctrinal statement. What percentage of the faculty uphold and affirm the TMU doctrinal statement? Is this a trick question? We hold firm to our doctrinal statement and so does our faculty — all of our faculty … 100%. How many countries are represented at TMU? It may be easier to answer this one by telling you which countries aren’t represented. Right now, our student body looks like an international shepherd’s pie. We have students from 30 countries. I’m from one of those other countries… how do I apply to TMU? Check out our step-by-step guide for International Students&nbsp;here. Is TMU accredited? We love this question because we’re not only accredited, we’re WASC accredited (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) and a member ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International) and other associations. That’s a lot of letters, and they all add up to one thing: TMU is a seriously decorated, seriously recognized academic institution. What can I do with my TMU degree? What can’t you do with it? Build an economic empire, write the great American novel, cure the common cold. A TMU education will help you find God’s plan for your career … God’s unique and perfect use for your unique and perfect array of gifts. Can’t beat that. Do TMU graduates attend Graduate School? Yes. Our graduates continue their educations at such institutions as Pepperdine, UCLA, Georgetown, Oxford, Duke, and USC. Twenty percent of TMU students attend immediately and 35% attend within five years. Medical schools attended by TMU grads include Baylor College of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Loma Linda University, University of Michigan, and College of Osteopathic Medicine. About 95% of our students who apply to med school get in. Seminaries: TMU grads have attended Western Conservative Baptist, Talbot School of Theology, Dallas Theological Seminary, The Master’s Seminary, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. How many home school students attend Master’s? Home school students constitute about a third of our student body, so we’ve got a nice mix. The other 2/3rds are split between public and private high school. What is there to do for fun? We can answer that question with two words in Spanish: Los Angeles. Being 30 minutes from the heart of L.A. means you are 30 minutes from (you can fill in the blank here). Want sun? How about a quick drive to Santa Monica or Malibu Beach? Like to shop? We’ve got a fantastic mall here in town, or you can always zip down the Hollywood freeway to Beverly Hills or Melrose Avenue. Like museums? The Getty is close and it’s free. How about a trip to Hollywoood, Disneyland, or Six Flags (which is right here in Santa Clarita)? You won’t ever be bored. Just don’t forget about your homework! Do students stay on campus all weekend? Even with everything Los Angeles has to offer, our students also enjoy just hanging out together on campus. Between dorm life, intramurals, sporting events, plays, concerts, or just kicking back at the Mustang Grill, there’s always plenty to do. Just make sure not to park your car next to Reese Field during a baseball game. Watching foul balls bounce off of windshields is another weekend pastime our students enjoy every spring. How many dorms do you have on campus and are they co-ed? We have 8 dorms on campus.&nbsp;All-girl dorms –&nbsp;Sweazy and&nbsp;Dixon Halls&nbsp;All-guy dorms –&nbsp;Slight and&nbsp;Waldock Halls“Split” dorms (guys’ halls separated from girls’ halls by a common lounge area) –&nbsp;Hotchkiss and&nbsp;Smith Halls&nbsp;For more information about dorm life check out our&nbsp;student life page. &nbsp; Apply Now Request Info The Graduate Studies department of the Master’s University welcomes applications from prospective students who are able to present strong academic records and a clear testimony of faith in Jesus Christ. In selecting students, the graduate admissions committee admits those for whom graduation is a reasonable expectation and who offer potential to contribute positively to the graduate studies community. Steps to Apply To be considered for admission into the graduate studies program, you will need to provide the following application components: Application for Graduate Admission (Online) Application fee ($50) Supplementary personal statements Official transcripts indicating the completion of a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited college or university Reference forms: academic, pastoral (or other lay-leader), and personal (forms provided with application) MABC Applicants Only: Writing sample, a 10-15 page sample of your academic work, demonstrating graduate study capability. *Prospective students of the Teaching Credential, Online program, or Seminary programs should consult those departments for application requirements and procedures. Application Deadlines **Summer Term ** \\ Domestic: March 1 International: December 15 **Fall Term **\\ Domestic: July 1 International: April 15 Applications may be submitted after the deadline, but we cannot guarantee that they will be given equal consideration with those submitted on time. It is preferred that residential-local students begin studies in a fall term. Because the intensive-modular courses form both the foundation and anchor for the entire distance student’s experience, we require distance students to start the program in a summer term. Exceptions are regularly made to this rule for applicants with a strong background in Biblical Studies (for MABS) or Biblical Counseling (for MABC) or for applicants starting their studies with a travel-study course; in such cases, permission for distance students to begin studies in the fall or spring terms is granted.

It is truly a blessing to work at the college I have loved and respected for so long.” While Catering Manager at Spanish Hills Golf &amp; Country Club, Shayna first heard of The Master’s University at the 1996 Golf Tournament. When the Lord saved her later that year, Shayna looked into attending TMU. However, it was not until much later that the Lord sovereignly directed her steps back to TMU.

A Favorite Scripture Verse: Romans 12:1-2 “Therefore, I urge you brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”",

His research and writing has focused on Christian Humanism in the Reformation, particularly the complex relationship between developing Reformed thought and Classical Graeco-Roman pagan mythology and philosophy. At Duke University he was taught and mentored by Stanley Fish, America’s leading literary theorist. He has worked on the citation of classical Greek and Latin authorities by Renaissance writers, published on theology and the arts, and recently completed a full-length work on John Milton and John Calvin. His first book, “Meaning at the Movies” on film and theology (Crossway, 2010) was an Amazon bestseller and nominated for Book of the Year in Christianity and Culture by the Book Retailers Association. His second book, “John Milton, Classical Learning, and the Progress of Virtue” was published by Classical Academic Press in 2015. Two shorter books are under contract and forthcoming in summer 2017: one on Dracula, and another on Paradise Lost. Professor Horner is the Founder and Director of The Master’s University in Italy Program, a six-week summer intensive study abroad semester. Students live in an ancient villa in the city that was the birthplace of the modern world in the Renaissance: beautiful Florence. We also spend time in Rome and Venice. A variety of Humanities courses revolve around the Renaissance Humanist’s question ‘quid est homo?’—‘what is man?’ We examine the basis for studying the Humanities and explore what it means to be human. http://www.masters.edu/italy Horner was named “Professor of the Year” in May 2001, his second year at The Master’s University, and again in 2007. He has taught at the University of Alabama and UNC-Chapel Hill, and was appointed Hudson Strode Scholar in Renaissance Studies (1994-96) at UA. At Master’s, Professor Horner teaches courses on Medieval and Renaissance literature, Film Studies, Shakespeare, Milton, John Calvin, Poetry and Poetics, Comedy, Critical Theory, Western Art History, Epic, Classical Christian Humanism, and Classical Latin. He is an Alcuin Fellow in the Society for Classical Learning. He holds an appointment as Visiting Assistant Professor of Latin at Fuller Seminary, and works in early printed books and rare manuscripts at The Huntington Library. Horner designed the original Humanities program in the Rhetoric School at Trinity Classical Academy, the fastest-growing classical school in the nation, and served as Chair for several years. He continues to mentor the teachers at Trinity. Prof. Horner speaks regularly in a number of venues including national radio, particularly on current theological trends, philosophy and popular culture. He has spoken to Berkeley students on Christianity and popular culture, was invited to give the endowed Kegel Lecture at Caltech on representations of human consciousness in philosophy and art, and speaks regularly on the radio and television with over 100 appearances to date. He and his wife, Joanne, have three children: Seth, Josiah and Rachel, and several grandchildren, and they live in Santa Clarita, California. They love to watch and discuss movies! Grant has been involved heavily in rock climbing, ice climbing, and mountaineering since 1979, rockclimbing at a world-class level through the 1980s and 1990s, and he has made five one-day speed-climbing ascents of Yosemite Valley’s 3000’ El Capitan – the largest vertical granite cliff in the world, and famously difficult. He is one of a handful of climbers who has done the “Nose” route on El Cap in less than 24 hours (usual ascents are 3-6 days; his record time is 12:52) and he is the only climber in the world to make such a speed-ascent on a first attempt and first visit to Yosemite. He spends much of the summer in the High Sierra on huge, high-altitude rock and ice walls, making numerous speed ascents of what are normally multi-day alpine peaks, often in a matter of hours, and sometimes solo-climbing two peaks as high as 14,000 feet in a single day. He has also recently rekindled a longtime passion for sailing around the Channel Islands off Southern California’s Pacific coast.",

    "text": "Financial Aid 101: The Basics “How will I pay for my education? Am I eligible for financial aid? Where do I begin?” The Office of Financial Aid can answer your questions. Whether you are a high school student, a college transfer, or an inquiring parent, we are here to help. Our aim is to provide you with a premium education at a price that considers your personal financial situation. Premium education, personal price. Types of Financial Aid There are two basic types of financial aid: gift aid and self-help aid. Gift aid refers to financial assistance that does not need to be repaid (i.e. scholarships or grants). Self-help aid is assistance that holds the recipient responsible for some sort of return (i.e. loans, work study). Funding from private sources (i.e. associations, religious groups, or corporations) also fall within these two groups. The Process Applying for financial aid can be intimidating, but that is why we have made the process as streamlined as possible. The steps are simple: Submit a TMU Financial Aid Application. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Submit all documents requested by the Office of Financial Aid. Missing documents can be viewed through your Self-Service. Receive your award letter and accept your awards online through Self-Service. If you have not yet been accepted to the university, you can still begin the financial aid process, but it is more streamlined once you are accepted and receive a username and password to access your information online. If you are required for verification by the government please complete the IRS Data Retrieval and Federal Verification Worksheet. Step-by-step verification information can be viewed on our Verification page. Communication Good communication with the Office of Financial Aid is essential to your financial success. You will not receive blanket mass letters from our office. If we contact you, it is because we require the information we are requesting. Our communication process is directly connected to your personal account. Each letter, email, or postcard you receive from the Office of Financial Aid relates* *to your specific situation, so be careful to respond promptly to all communication attempts.

    "title": "Verification Process",
    "text": "Federal Verification Process When you submit the FAFSA on the Web, you may be randomly selected by the Federal processor for a process called “verification.” This means the Department of Education requires our office to determine the accuracy of the information provided on your FAFSA on the Web application. If you receive this notification, please complete the following steps in compliance with Federal guidelines. NOTE: The priority deadline is March 2nd. The following steps must be completed before March 2nd to be considered for priority awarding. Verification Steps: Complete the IRS Data Retrieval through FAFSA on the Web (See our IRS Data Retrieval Guide). Submit the Federal Verification Worksheet to the Office of Financial Aid. 2017-18 Federal Verification Worksheet 2016-17 Federal Verification Worksheet Sign and submit our Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. Submit all documents listed above and/or requested by the Office of Financial Aid by March 2nd for priority awarding. Some scholarships and grants may require additional forms, which can be found here. What is the IRS Data Retrieval? The IRS Data Retrieval is a feature of FAFSA on the web, which links your FAFSA with your already filed federal tax information through the IRS. You may update your FAFSA by linking to your federal taxes and pulling your tax data directly from the IRS ‘auto-filling” the tax portion of your FAFSA. Taxes submitted electronically require 2-3 weeks before they can be requested. If they were submitted by paper, they will require up to 8-11 weeks. If you do not wish to complete the IRS Data retrieval and are required for verification, you must contact the IRS to request a copy of student and/or parent’s IRS tax transcript to provide to The Office of Financial Aid (See below, “Requesting an IRS transcript”). How to use the IRS Data Retrieval: See our IRS Data Retrieval Step by Step Guide. NOTE: The student and parent must go to the IRS separately. Please ensure that you have a valid Social Security Number and have already filed taxes for the previous year. What if I Cannot Complete the IRS Data Retrieval? If you cannot complete Step 1 (above), you may request an IRS transcript and submit it to the Office of Financial Aid. (See our guide on How to Request an IRS Tax Transcript). You must request an IRS transcript if: • You (or your parent) did not use the IRS Data Retrieval Process either at initial FAFSA filing or through subsequent corrections.\\ • You changed information after using the IRS Data retrieval process.\\ • Your tax status is ‘Married, filing separately.’\\ • Your parents filed separate tax returns.\\ • You (or your parent) had a change in marital status after the end of the tax year on December 31.\\ • You (or your parent) filed an amended tax return.\\ • You filed taxes outside the U.S. Requesting an IRS Transcript: On the IRS website choose “Get Transcript of Your Tax Records” or call 800.908.9946 and request the transcript by phone (See our guide on How to Request an IRS Tax Transcript). You may also request one in writing by completing the IRS form 4506T-EZ and mailing it to the IRS. Select the “Get Transcript by Mail” option. Fill in the requested information and request the Return Transcript. Once you receive your transcript submit it to the Office of Financial Aid for verification.

    "title": "University Exchange",
    "text": "Check out the new University Exchange site Shop Now A bookstore is a physical representation of an institution; it represents who we are. October 2016 The Master’s University Bookstore closed its doors and was cleared out for renovation. Paper covered the windows and thin wood walls concealed the facade — hiding the work being done, but unable to silence the sound of nails being hammered in or stifle the smell of fresh paint. On February 3rd the mystery will be revealed. The walls will come down and the students, faculty, staff, visitors and greater community will be welcomed to the new University Exchange, or UE for short. “This is one of the first big things that’s happened for the students in a while,” Robert Jensen of University Marketing said, “the University Exchange represents them. The students are the priority. You won’t recognize it from the old bookstore. The exterior framework did not change but the interior space was completely re-designed. The entire process has been an alumni effort as well, with the designers and general contractor all being graduates of Master’s U.” The change from college to university took place in early August and represents more than a lexical difference. It is an exciting step in not only highlighting the unique strengths already present here, but also elevating the standards and expectations by which the university functions. The bookstore is only one step in the means to a greater end. Jensen explained, “UE will no longer simply fill a need but create an experience. . . an experience that immediately fills students and alumni with a sense of pride in their university — the moment you walk into this place you are going to feel a part of the school and actually want to represent it outside of the canyon.” There will be an entire section featuring the collected works of our president, Dr. John MacArthur, along with shelves filled with classic literature recommended by the English faculty, books suggested by the Business and History departments, biographies, entrepreneurial and more. The latter offered are all supplemental to the course textbooks students will be able to purchase online (ue.masters.edu). However, UE will not only have books. Emily Clark, a senior Biblical Counseling major at Master’s U, commented, “It’s exciting because the staff is putting a lot of work into giving it a whole new look. It will be ivy league and collegiate, perhaps more so than any other university. It’s exciting to make our school presentable to people. Merchandise sells a school to high schoolers; when something looks nice it will bring people in.” The University Exchange is more than books or merchandise. Everything about the store — the design, books, atmosphere, product and even the team behind it —- brings together the past, present and future of The Master’s University. The UE will offer multiple generations of students and guests the opportunity to take a piece of the university with them, united under one cohesive identity. Fall 2017 Books",

In selecting students, the graduate admissions committee admits those for whom graduation is a reasonable expectation and who offer potential to contribute positively to the graduate studies community. Steps to Apply To be considered for admission into the graduate studies program, you will need to provide the following application components: Application for Graduate Admission (Online) Application fee ($50) Supplementary personal statements Official transcripts indicating the completion of a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited college or university Reference forms: academic, pastoral (or other lay-leader), and personal (forms provided with application) MABC Applicants Only: Writing sample, a 10-15 page sample of your academic work, demonstrating graduate study capability. *Prospective students of the Teaching Credential, Online program, or Seminary programs should consult those departments for application requirements and procedures.

It is preferred that residential-local students begin studies in a fall term. Because the intensive-modular courses form both the foundation and anchor for the entire distance student’s experience, we require distance students to start the program in a summer term. Exceptions are regularly made to this rule for applicants with a strong background in Biblical Studies (for MABS) or Biblical Counseling (for MABC) or for applicants starting their studies with a travel-study course; in such cases, permission for distance students to begin studies in the fall or spring terms is granted.

Micah Dixon Mike Jackson Morgan Pedrick Maddie Olling Step 1 Apply Step 2 1. Request Transcripts A transcript is a document that reflects the completion of your secondary school education or the equivalent. Transcripts list the courses you took, the grading scale used, and the grades (marks) you obtained. The Master’s University prefers that all transcripts sent to us also be accompanied by an American GPA equivalent (given on a 4.0 scale). This evaluation should be done by a credential evaluation service. If your transcript does not already give a cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale, then please have such an evaluation performed. We suggest the following two evaluators, though others are available. Look for a credential evaluation service that holds an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) membership, to ensure the highest possible accuracy in your transcript evaluation. Please follow the instructions on the evaluators’ websites. World Education Services Educational Credential Evaluators All transcripts must be officially translated into English, and bear both the original signature (not a photocopy) of the school official and the official school seal. Transfer Students (those who have completed any post-secondary coursework) should also have their college or university transcripts submitted, likewise officially translated into English. Transfer students seeking transfer credit should make sure to have a course-by-course evaluation performed, if needing their transcripts evaluated according to paragraph 2, above. Please keep in mind that it may take several weeks for your school to process and mail an official transcript (in addition to the time the transcripts spend in transit, which varies from country to country). Likewise, the evaluation process may also take several days or weeks. Accordingly, please submit your transcripts requests early in the application process. All official and evaluated transcripts should be sent to: The Master’s University - Office of Admissions \\ 21726 Placerita Canyon Road \\ Santa Clarita, CA 91321 \\ USA 2. Submit English Language Test Score Your academic success at The Master’s University depends a great deal upon your fluency in the English language. In order to determine your level of proficiency, international applicants must sit for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System). The TOEFL is an official exam supervised by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service sends an official report noting your score on the exam to an institution of your choice. You may obtain information about this test at www.toefl.org. When you apply for the test you may have your results sent to The Master’s University by referencing our school code, which is 4411. To be considered for admission to The Master’s University, applicants must earn a score of at least 80 on the internet-based (iBT) TOEFL or a 550 on paper-based version. IELTS is jointly managed by the British Council, IDT:IELTS Australia, and the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Information about sitting for the IELTS can be found on their web site at www.ielts.org. The Master’s University requires a band score of 6.5 or higher. Registration for these exams often must be secured several months in advance. Please plan accordingly. Note to Native English Speakers:\\ If you are a native English speaker, you should take either the SAT or ACT, in lieu of the TOEFL or IELTS. Our school code for the SAT is 4411, and for the ACT it is 0303. Note to Transfer Students:\\ If you have completed 24 or more semester units of transferable coursework at an accredited American university or college (but not just in an ESL program), the requirements for submitting exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, or ACT) are waived. 3.

Our staff is here to guide you through this process—you’re not on your own! Please contact Amy Bryerton, International Admissions Counselor, with any additional questions you have about international financial aid. Step 4 Finalize Visa Requirements Most international students will need an F-1 (student) visa to study at The Master’s University. Once an international student receives his or her acceptance letter and financial aid award package, an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility may be obtained with the assistance of our Designated School Official (DSO). The I-20 can in turn be used to apply for an F-1 visa as a U.S. embassy or consulate. Of course, you as an individual are responsible for obtaining and maintaining a valid passport from your home country. Before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility can be issued, the United States Department of State government requires that each international student be able to document his or her ability to afford an education at The Master’s University. Once you have received your financial aid package, you will be asked to submit documentation regarding the remainder of needed funds. This documentation can come from you the student, your family, or any number of sponsors. Each person must fill out, sign, and return the appropriate affidavit of support (see below) with a bank statement or letter from a bank official verifying the availability of funds. Again, we require these documents before we can begin to prepare your I-20, the document that will allow you to apply for an F-1 visa at an American consulate or embassy. Please do not submit these forms until you have been notified to do so by the Office of International Student Advancement: Student/Parent Affidavit of Support Form Sponsor Affidavit of Support Form Additional information about obtaining and maintaining your visa and/or F-1 student status will be provided once you have been accepted to The Master’s University and have received your financial aid package. In the meantime, general information about applying for a student visa can be found on the U.S. Government’s “Study in the States” website here. Admissions - Frequently Asked Questions Where is The Master’s University Located? We’re tucked into a cozy canyon community about 30 minutes up the freeway from downtown L.A , the beach or Hollywood! When can I visit the school? That’s a great question because there are so many choices. First off, you should know that our doors are always open. Drop in whenever you want. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are great because that’s when we hold chapel services, but you can experience our heart for the Lord any day of the week. If you’re up for a more structured event, we hold College View Weekends twice a year. You can also&nbsp;schedule a personalized tour with a few mouse clicks. What are the TMU school codes? They are: FAFSA School Code: 001220 SAT School Code: 4411 ACT Code: 0303 What kind of financial aid is offered at TMU? The important thing to know here is that a TMU education is a LOT more affordable than you think. We offer federal, state, institutional aid in the form of grants, loans, need based and merit based scholarships, and work study programs. Most of our students (93% at last count) receive some form of financial – why not you? The average TMU student receives over $20,000 in financial aid each year. Just make sure to get your application in early and to submit your FAFSA! How much will TMU cost for&nbsp;me personally? Great question! Seeing how everyone’s financial situation is different, we recommend using our Total Price Calculator. To access our Total Price Calculator,&nbsp;click here. How many programs do we offer? This answer surprises people because they think we only offer Bible classes. The truth is we are a liberal arts college built on a biblical foundation, and that means variety. We offer 13 majors and over 55 areas of study. What are the top 6 majors? Hmmm … that’s a tough question. We think all of our majors are great. But if we must rank them, our most attended are: Business, Biology, Communication, Bible, and Music. Will my credits transfer from________________? We get this one a lot. The answer depends on a few factors: Namely, where are the credits coming from (the college must be accredited) and what kind of grades did you earn (nothing below a C is accepted). And yes, we do accept CLEP, AP, and IB credits. Check out our articulation agreements with CA schools at www.masters.edu/articulation How many units do I need to be considered a transfer student? The magic number here is 24 semester units (36 quarter units), and those need to be credits that you completed after high school graduation.&nbsp;But don’t sweat it. If you have less than 24 units, we’ll just go off your high school transcript and test scores. What is the average class size at TMU? We love this question because it highlights one of our best features: personal attention. Our lower division classes range from 30-40 students, and our upper division classes are limited to about 8-15. Some Bible classes are bigger (close to 100 students), but over the past four years, our average class size is 20-25 students. That’s a great environment in which too engage your professors – and for them to engage you! What is the student/teacher ratio? The ratio is 10-to-1. In other words, you will get to know your profs. And they will get to invest in you. What classes should I take if I am transferring to TMU from a community college? The first place to look for answers to this one is in our Academic Catalog – lots of helpful specifics there. After that, you should talk to one of our counselors (they’re extremely helpful and they speak in plain English) or go straight to the Registrar’s Office – the buck stops there. You’ll be glad to know we have articulation agreements with most community colleges in California, Oregon, Washington, and some in Arizona. We’ll contact them for you and help you sort it all out. What kind of rules does TMU have? The most important rule you need to know about is also the rule that’s most important to us: we call it the Rule of Grace. It governs the rest of them, so we’ll start there. After that, we have a small handful of parameters (recently revised). Check out the&nbsp;Student Handbook for the details. Is chapel required? Chapel is the hub of the TMU community and attendance is required. Chapel meets three times per week and students can miss up to six per semester. What sports are offered at TMU? You'll find Mustangs competing on the following teams: MEN Basketball Baseball Soccer X-Country Track Golf WOMEN Basketball Soccer X-Country Track Volleyball We also offer a fierce (and fun) menu of intramural sports: Basketball, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, Softball, Golf, Tennis, Flag Football, Soccer, Dodge Ball. Pack your cleats. What is the male/female ratio at TMU? While many Christian colleges operate on a female/male ratio of two or even three to one, we’ve got a level playing field here. Translation: our guy-to-gal ratio is 1-to-1. Sorry, guys. Can I bring a car to school? Remember, this is L.A. Of course you can bring a car (but you can get by without it). Just pack an extra $45 per semester to cover the parking fee. And make sure to read the parking signs! Are there any restrictions on having a car at TMU? A few. The first is obvious – make sure your car is properly registered and adequately insured (the state of California came up with that one). You should also know that you can’t just park anywhere. But you do have dorm parking. Finally, for you do-it-yourselfers, make sure you get permission before you decide to throw your car up on blocks and change out the transmission in front of Hotchkiss Hall. Is our campus secure? Absolutely. Our students are our most precious commodity, and we take our stewardship of them seriously. We are situated in a quiet, safe neighborhood, but we take nothing for granted. Our campus security officers patrol the campus 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Our annual crime report speaks for itself--find a copy here. Can I live off campus? What? And miss all the perks of campus life? If you must, there are some restrictions. Full-time students can live off campus, if they're over the age of 21 and have come in as freshmen or are married. Some students live off campus (usually with Mom and Dad) and commute. But most prefer the TMU community. You can check out the Student Handbook for more specifics. What are TMU’s admission requirements? Faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior High school graduate, GED, or California High School Proficiency Exam Application Pastor Recommendation Personal Statements SAT/ACT Scores High school and or college transcripts Application Fee: $40 (waived during Early Action) Early Action Deadline: Your application must be postmarked by November 15, although financial aid applications can come later. We’ll let you know if you’ve been accepted within 2-3 weeks of receiving your completed application. Priority Deadline: March 2nd. However, we continue to asked applications on a \"rolling\" basis even after our Priority Deadline. Do I qualify for financial aid? Let’s put it this way, if you don’t, you’re in the minority … way in the minority. About 93% of our students qualify for financial aid. Does TMU prefer the SAT or ACT? Take your pick. Either one works for us. But if you take the SAT, make sure it’s the SAT I because we don’t use the SAT II. What are academic guidelines for GPA and test scores? There are a number of factors, so we don't publish specific minimums. We're looking for students who have succeeded in college preparatory high school classes, and have earned above average test scores on the SAT or ACT. If a student falls below the recommended test score or grade point average, the student could still be admitted as part of our Program for Academic Support and Success (PASS). What denomination is TMU? We believe the Bible is literally true and divinely inspired. If that’s a denomination, then that’s us. Other than that we are non-denominational.&nbsp;Click here to read over our doctrinal statement. What percentage of the faculty uphold and affirm the TMU doctrinal statement? Is this a trick question? We hold firm to our doctrinal statement and so does our faculty — all of our faculty … 100%. How many countries are represented at TMU? It may be easier to answer this one by telling you which countries aren’t represented. Right now, our student body looks like an international shepherd’s pie. We have students from 30 countries. I’m from one of those other countries… how do I apply to TMU? Check out our step-by-step guide for International Students&nbsp;here. Is TMU accredited? We love this question because we’re not only accredited, we’re WASC accredited (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) and a member ACSI (Association of Christian Schools International) and other associations. That’s a lot of letters, and they all add up to one thing: TMU is a seriously decorated, seriously recognized academic institution. What can I do with my TMU degree? What can’t you do with it? Build an economic empire, write the great American novel, cure the common cold. A TMU education will help you find God’s plan for your career … God’s unique and perfect use for your unique and perfect array of gifts. Can’t beat that. Do TMU graduates attend Graduate School? Yes. Our graduates continue their educations at such institutions as Pepperdine, UCLA, Georgetown, Oxford, Duke, and USC. Twenty percent of TMU students attend immediately and 35% attend within five years. Medical schools attended by TMU grads include Baylor College of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Loma Linda University, University of Michigan, and College of Osteopathic Medicine. About 95% of our students who apply to med school get in. Seminaries: TMU grads have attended Western Conservative Baptist, Talbot School of Theology, Dallas Theological Seminary, The Master’s Seminary, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. How many home school students attend Master’s? Home school students constitute about a third of our student body, so we’ve got a nice mix. The other 2/3rds are split between public and private high school. What is there to do for fun? We can answer that question with two words in Spanish: Los Angeles. Being 30 minutes from the heart of L.A. means you are 30 minutes from (you can fill in the blank here). Want sun? How about a quick drive to Santa Monica or Malibu Beach? Like to shop? We’ve got a fantastic mall here in town, or you can always zip down the Hollywood freeway to Beverly Hills or Melrose Avenue. Like museums? The Getty is close and it’s free. How about a trip to Hollywoood, Disneyland, or Six Flags (which is right here in Santa Clarita)? You won’t ever be bored. Just don’t forget about your homework! Do students stay on campus all weekend? Even with everything Los Angeles has to offer, our students also enjoy just hanging out together on campus. Between dorm life, intramurals, sporting events, plays, concerts, or just kicking back at the Mustang Grill, there’s always plenty to do. Just make sure not to park your car next to Reese Field during a baseball game. Watching foul balls bounce off of windshields is another weekend pastime our students enjoy every spring. How many dorms do you have on campus and are they co-ed? We have 8 dorms on campus.&nbsp;All-girl dorms –&nbsp;Sweazy and&nbsp;Dixon Halls&nbsp;All-guy dorms –&nbsp;Slight and&nbsp;Waldock Halls“Split” dorms (guys’ halls separated from girls’ halls by a common lounge area) –&nbsp;Hotchkiss and&nbsp;Smith Halls&nbsp;For more information about dorm life check out our&nbsp;student life page. &nbsp;",
