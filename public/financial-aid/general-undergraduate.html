<h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

<p>Any student accepted and enrolled full-time at The Master’s University who receives a scholarship from their local church is eligible for the Ministry Matching Grant (MMG). Both the church’s scholarship and the MMG will be applied directly to the student’s account and will be split between the Fall and Spring semesters.</p>

<h3 id="amount">Amount</h3>

<p>The Master’s University will match the church’s scholarship gift dollar-for-dollar. New ministry-match scholarship recipients for the 2015-16 academic year can receive up to $1,500 per year and ministry match scholarships that students have received in past years will be matched up to the previous year’s amount. There is no minimum or maximum amount that a church can give for the scholarship. However, the matching portion from The Master’s University will never exceed the stated amount above or the matched amount from a previous year. Please contact the <a href="mailto:financialaid@masters.edu">Office of Financial Aid</a> for specific questions.</p>

<h3 id="funding">Funding</h3>
