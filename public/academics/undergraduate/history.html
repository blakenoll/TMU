  <meta name="description" content="The Department of History and Political Studies is designed to help all students develop an understanding of the complex factors that have produced the civilizations of the present and also aid students in becoming responsible Christian citizens. Especially because of our emphasis on systematic research and analysis, the History and Political Studies majors receive instruction in preparing for careers in education, business, government service, public relations, or library work, as well as graduate study in law, theology, history, or political science.


The department acknowledges that, in human affairs of the past, present and future, God is sovereign. With that foundational truth, students are aided in developing Christian philosophies of history and politics as parts of an overarching biblically-based world view.
The department offers two Bachelor of Arts degrees with five different areas of emphasis. Every course should help students integrate Christian faith and the academic fields.
When pursuing a Political Studies degree from our Christian university in California students may choose from three available emphases: American Politics, Constitutional Law, or Political Theory. Although a capable person can get into law school with almost any major, the Constitutional Law emphasis constitutes excellent preparation for law school.


Christian students desiring a History degree may choose Church History or General History. Anyone seeking a History major and planning to attend seminary should choose the Church History emphasis. Anyone wanting to teach history should read the following paragraphs carefully.

* A survey taken in 2012 shows that of alumni from our department nearly 50% work in government, 12.5% work in education and another 12.5% in ministry

* There are 5-15 students in major classes allowing for close teacher-student mentorship and a high-level of scholarship">

          <p>The Department of History and Political Studies is designed to help all students develop an understanding of the complex factors that have produced the civilizations of the present and also aid students in becoming responsible Christian citizens. Especially because of our emphasis on systematic research and analysis, the History and Political Studies majors receive instruction in preparing for careers in education, business, government service, public relations, or library work, as well as graduate study in law, theology, history, or political science.


The department acknowledges that, in human affairs of the past, present and future, God is sovereign. With that foundational truth, students are aided in developing Christian philosophies of history and politics as parts of an overarching biblically-based world view.
The department offers two Bachelor of Arts degrees with five different areas of emphasis. Every course should help students integrate Christian faith and the academic fields.
When pursuing a Political Studies degree from our Christian university in California students may choose from three available emphases: American Politics, Constitutional Law, or Political Theory. Although a capable person can get into law school with almost any major, the Constitutional Law emphasis constitutes excellent preparation for law school.


Christian students desiring a History degree may choose Church History or General History. Anyone seeking a History major and planning to attend seminary should choose the Church History emphasis. Anyone wanting to teach history should read the following paragraphs carefully.

* A survey taken in 2012 shows that of alumni from our department nearly 50% work in government, 12.5% work in education and another 12.5% in ministry

* There are 5-15 students in major classes allowing for close teacher-student mentorship and a high-level of scholarship</p>

            <p>The Department of History and Political Studies is designed to help all students develop an understanding of the complex factors that have produced the civilizations of the present and also aid students in becoming responsible Christian citizens. Especially because of our emphasis on systematic research and analysis, the History and Political Studies majors receive instruction in preparing for careers in education, business, government service, public relations, or library work, as well as graduate study in law, theology, history, or political science.</p>

<p>The department acknowledges that, in human affairs of the past, present and future, God is sovereign. With that foundational truth, students are aided in developing Christian philosophies of history and politics as parts of an overarching biblically-based world view.
The department offers two Bachelor of Arts degrees with five different areas of emphasis. Every course should help students integrate Christian faith and the academic fields.
When pursuing a Political Studies degree from our Christian university in California students may choose from three available emphases: American Politics, Constitutional Law, or Political Theory. Although a capable person can get into law school with almost any major, the Constitutional Law emphasis constitutes excellent preparation for law school.</p>

<p>Christian students desiring a History degree may choose Church History or General History. Anyone seeking a History major and planning to attend seminary should choose the Church History emphasis. Anyone wanting to teach history should read the following paragraphs carefully.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A survey taken in 2012 shows that of alumni from our department nearly 50% work in government, 12.5% work in education and another 12.5% in ministry</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 5-15 students in major classes allowing for close teacher-student mentorship and a high-level of scholarship</p>
  </li>
