<p>Macroeconomics (ECN200):</p>

<p>This course is an introduction to macroeconomic principles and terminology. The primary focus is on the aggregate U.S. economy and the policy decisions that state and federal lawmakers face. Topics include: review of the economic problem, measuring GNP, money and banking, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policy, and inflation.</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>

Understand the fundamental concepts of microeconomics (i.e. firm behavior, competition, monopolistic completion, monopoly).
Understand the fundamental concepts of macroeconomics (i.e.  Productivity, business cycles, monetary policy, fiscal policy, banking system, employment, inflation).
To apply these areas of knowledge to practical and spiritual decisions throughout one’s life.

English Literature I (E211):</p>

Massive changes in language, religion, politics, art forms – the whole of culture and society – make this era of history both fascinating and difficult.

Develop an ability to read and understand a wide variety of literary texts and to interpret these in the light of a biblical worldview
Experience personal spiritual growth, seen in an increased capability for reading non-biblical materials in a sensitive, biblically-critical mode
Appreciate the creative artistry of a given artifact while remaining aware of it as the product of sinful humanity
Be able to write about and discuss literary art from a definitively Christ-centered position.
U.S. Government (POL 220):</p>

<p>Objectives:</p>

<p>Through studying the relationship between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the student should:</p>

<p>Gain not only a new appreciation for both documents but also a new understanding as to how they fit together and complement one another
Gain an appreciation for the collective wisdom of the founders themselves
Understand and appreciate the Bill of Rights and the amending process
Understand and appreciate our basic political institutions
