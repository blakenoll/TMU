### *Reservations*

**When do I need to turn in my anticipated numbers?**

*Anticipated numbers for catering, media, room setup and a final agenda or program should be confirmed two weeks (14 days) prior to the function. A signed Summary of Bookings verifying event information will be due at this time.*

**If we have fewer numbers than anticipated, can we pay for actual numbers?**

*No. Groups are contractually obligated to pay per their guaranteed numbers.*

**Can we have whole families stay in the dorm rooms?**

*Families are permitted in the dorms. However, the dorm set-up is not designed for children.*

*Children 5 and older must be counted in the housing numbers and must sleep in their own bed. Children under the age of 5 are permitted to stay in the dorms with their parents in the condition that the parents provide a pack-&-play (or similar item) and place it against the back wall. Extra mattresses on the floor are not permitted due to fire codes and safety regulations.*

**How late can I make changes to my reservations?**

*A signed Summary of Bookings with the guaranteed number and final requests for services is required two weeks prior to the start of your event. Requests for changes made after this deadline must be submitted in writing and will incur additional fees. Each addition will incur a charge of $150 per change plus the cost of facilitating the change. No requests can be guaranteed within fourteen days of the scheduled event.*

**Do I have to have insurance for my event?**

*Yes. The Master’s University requires all events to secure event insurance as part of the reservation process. Any homeowner’s insurance agency should be able to provide this, or we have a one-time option available for insurance through TMU.*

### *Payments*

**When should I make the final payment?**

**Do I make a separate check out to Bon Appetit, or is it included in my check to Master’s?**

**Do you offer discounts to alumni and faculty and staff?**

*Yes. We provide a 20% off discount to all alumni, faculty, and staff.*

**Can my group get a discount since we are a ministry?**

However, if your event falls during our summer schedule (May-August), we may not have the capabilities to provide equipment or personnel for A/V support. Groups are welcome to bring their own equipment, and we would be happy to provide groups with a list of local vendors who may be able to accommodate your needs.*

**Can we do a hybrid of your equipment and our own?**

*No. You must either bring all of your own equipment, or use ours with the help of a TMU technician.*

**Is there parking near the dorms?**

However, if you are using bus transportation, we recommend that your buses drop your group off in the main parking lot in front of the Campus Safety Office, and then proceed to the side of Pete Reese Field to be parked. It will be a short walk uphill for your group up to the dorms from this lot. Campus Safety officers will be available to help direct your group and provide any assistance for your drivers.*
