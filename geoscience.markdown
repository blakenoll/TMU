**In the fall of 2018**, The Master’s University will be launching a new geoscience major with two different emphasis tracks: geology and environmental science.

Trips to local geological sites are a significant part of this program, and you’ll get the chance to study God's creation in breathtaking locations like Death Valley, the Grand Canyon and more.
