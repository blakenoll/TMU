  ## Interlibrary Loan Service

  Interlibrary Loan (ILL) is a voluntary system of sharing materials between libraries. ILL provides access to items not currently available in our own library collection or not available in full-text through our online databases.

  This service is available to all TMU students, faculty and staff who reside locally. Online Program students, Summer Institute Program students and Non TMU patrons, who hold a current TMU library card, should request ILL items through a local public library. International students may contact the Reference Librarian, Miss T., for other possible alternatives ([jtillman@masters.edu](mailto:jtillman@masters.edu)). Master's Seminary students must request ILL through The Master's Seminary Library.

  ## Interlibrary Loan Manager

  Grace Kamffer may be contacted by email [gkamffer@masters.edu](mailto:gkamffer@masters.edu)

  ## Requesting Material

  All ILL requests must be checked by the patron against TMU holdings prior to placing the request to verify that the item is unavailable from the TMU Library.

  A limit of 5 ILL requests per day, per student may be submitted.

  ILL request may be made directly through the WorldCat Discovery search platform. When a needed item is found but not held by the Powell Library, simple select the "Request item" button under "Availability" within the item record.  From off campus it is necessary to "Sign in" first.

  ILL forms may also be accessed through the links above. There is a separate form for periodicals and one for books, chapters or specific pages from books. Be sure to also request the title and verso when requesting a portion of a book so you will be able to properly cite your source. Submitting an ILL form for periodicals and portions of books indicates the patron has read the copyright statement and is willing to comply with all pertinent [copyright laws](http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/dmca/the-copyright-law.aspx "The Copyright Law"). These ILL requests will not be sent without it.

  ### Items not available through ILL

  * eBooks

  * Textbooks that are in use during the current semester

  * Books published before 1900

  * Newly published books

  * Dissertations and Theses

  * AV materials (videos, CDs, DVDs, tape cassettes, LPs, etc. are almost impossible to get)

  * Genealogy materials

  Waiting for ILL items

  After submitting the request the average wait time for books is between 7 to 10 days and for articles, chapters in books or pages from books is between 3 to 5 days although it may take longer.

  ### Picking up items

  All ILL books must be picked up in the library. Patrons will be notified by email when the item is available. Books will not be sent to patrons by U.S.P.S. or by campus mail. Articles, chapters and pages will be sent to patrons through email.

  ### Cost

  There are no charges for borrowing books, copies of book chapters, pages or copies of journal articles.

  ### Loan Periods

  Loan periods are set by the lending libraries. Books are generally loaned for 2 to 4 weeks. Book chapters and pages like articles are yours to keep.

  ## Renewing ILL Books

  Renewals are at the discretion of the lending library. One renewal is usually available unless otherwise indicated on the item. Renewal requests must be made to the InterLibrary Loan Manager by email ([gkamffer@masters.edu](mailto:gkamffer@masters.edu)) on or before the due date. The ILL department will email the patron with the new due date.

  ILLs cannot be renewed at the circulation desk. They must be renewed through the TMU ILL department. Renewals are not needed for copies of articles as they become the property of the patron.

  Loans are made possible through the courtesy of another library. Respect their generosity by returning material on time.

  ### Overdues

  Overdue material will incur fines and possible blocks on the patron record.

  A fine of $1.00 per day per item will be charged for items not returned or renewed by the due date.

  Overdues on any library items in excess of $25 will block future use of ILL until fines are paid.

  ### Lost or damaged ILL books

  Borrowers are responsible for lost or damaged books.

It is our privilege to serve you and contribute as much as possible to helping you develop your studies in a God honoring way. Take a few minutes and familiarize yourself with the particulars of our library.

  The Robert L. Powell Library exists to support the academic and scholarly programs of The Master's University and to serve primarily its faculty, staff and currently enrolled students. TMU Alumni, [The Master's Seminary (TMS)](http://www.tms.edu) and other [visitors](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryvisitors) are welcome to use this library but must bear in mind that our first priority is to the TMU community.

  Every patron of the Robert L. Powell Library is accountable for abiding by all applicable [policies](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices#s-lib-ctab-14323030-0), [procedures](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices#s-lib-ctab-14322964-0) and [copyright laws](http://masters.libguides.com/copyright).

  ## [Patron Registration & ID Cards](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/lendingpolicy)

  A completed [Patron Registration form](http://www.masters.edu/media/747166/Patron%20Registration%20Form-general.pdf) will need to be submitted to the Circulation Manager (Chloe Gustke, cgustke@masters.edu) before an ID card can be made. The Master's University ID card must be presented to circulation desk personnel whenever materials are checked out. All new students, faculty and staff will be given one card at no charge. However, there is a $5 fee to replace lost or broken cards. ID cards that have been worn to the point that the photo, barcode and/or magnetic strip are no longer viable may be replaced without the fee. Appointments for making replacement ID cards should be made with the Circulation Manager or the University Librarian.

  TMS students may use their seminary ID cards to check out materials at The Master's University. Refer to the [Reciprocal Arrangements](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices#s-lib-ctab-14322964-10) page on this Web site for details on TMU/TMS borrowing privileges.

  Visitors desiring to check out circulating materials may apply for a resident library card. See "VISITORS" below for details.

  In person: bring the materials to the Circulation Desk.

  ## [Placing a Hold](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices "Library Services")

  Placing a "hold" on an item allows patrons to put themselves on a waiting list for the item as soon as it is returned. A hold can only be placed on an item that is already checked out. When the item has been returned the patron who has placed the hold will be notified. The patron then has one week to pick up the item before it is reshelved. Items with a hold placed on them cannot be renewed.

  To place a hold select the "Request" tab found with the record of the item wanted.

  ## [Media Technology](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices "Media Technology")

  Desktop Computers are located throughout the main floor of the library. There is one computer dedicated for library catalog use only and it is labeled accordingly (Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)). The rest of the computers provide access to the library catalog, MasterNet, the Internet, the library's online subscription databases and indexes as well as other programs made possible by the [IT Operations](http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/computerservices.aspx "IT Operations") department including word-processing. There are also some computers with special programs intended for specific courses. Students enrolled in the courses needing those programs have priority use of these computers.

  In addition to the hardwired computers available to all patrons, the library is fitted with wireless connection to the MasterNet network. Wireless access cannot be provided to everyone due to licensing, security and administrative restrictions. Therefore, only currently enrolled [TMU traditional students](http://www2.masters.edu/DeptPageNew.asp?PageID=2051), [DCP, Credential, & MABC students](http://www2.masters.edu/DeptPageNew.asp?PageID=551) and [TMS students](http://www2.masters.edu/DeptPageNew.asp?PageID=1582) may purchase wireless network access. TMU and TMS alumni, resident card holders and visitors are not eligible for wireless network access. TMS staff and faculty may petition the [IT Operations](http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/computerservices.aspx "IT Operations") department. where the need will be determined on a case by case basis.

  ## [Audio/Video Equipment](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices "Reciprocal Arrangements")

  DVD players are available for use in the library. Data Projectors are available for faculty and staff. All audio-video equipment must remain in the library at all times unless required for classroom use and reserved in advance. Reservations for data projectors may be made only by TMU faculty or staff for campus related activities. There is no pick up and delivery service available. Contact the circulation desk for further details on policy and procedure. In keeping with copyright law (Title 17 of the United States Code,), data projectors may not be used by anyone on campus except by faculty for in class related activities.

  ## [Reciprocal Arrangements](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryservices "Reciprocal Arrangements")

  This applies to currently enrolled students, faculty and staff of TMU and the reciprocating institution. Reciprocal arrangements do not apply to any other TMU library cardholders.

  The individual borrower is subject to the rules and regulations established by the lending library, including, but not limited to, those rules that govern access to and the availability of library materials, loan periods, renewals, recall, and delinquency and lost materials charges. TMU patrons are expected to make themselves aware of the policies and regulations of each library used. The borrower is expected to protect materials and return them directly to the lending library by the due date. Charges for late, lost or damaged materials are the responsibility of the borrower. Fines, fees and replacement costs for library materials will be determined by the lending libraries in accordance with their existing policies.

  The Master's Seminary and The Master's University Libraries have a reciprocal agreement, which makes the collective resources available to both student bodies and faculty. TMU/TMS patrons needing resources from the university/seminary may obtain them from the respective library's circulation departments, filling out a patron registration form and presenting his/her student ID. TMS patrons may only check out 15 items at one time. Exceptions may be granted by either the Librarian or Circulation Manager.

  Biola University and The Master's University have established mutual borrowing privileges with currently enrolled students, faculty and staff. Both libraries will provide direct loan service to eligible and properly identified members of each other's campus community for unrestricted and available materials upon presentation of proper identification, the completion of the library card registration form and the issuance of a library card. The library cards are subject to renewal each semester or term.

  The Oviatt Library at California State University Northridge (CSUN) is available to residents, like TMU students for an annual fee of $50.00. This service is provided through the Friends of the Library, an auxiliary support organization of CSUN library. Students utilizing this service receive a patron card that allows normal lending privileges, however it excludes access to the CSUN network with their corresponding databases. Coin operated temporary parking permits are available in designated lots only.

  ## New Book Shelf

  Books new to the library are on the display book case in the Main Collection room on the first floor. These materials will remain on the display shelves for about two weeks or until someone checks them out, whichever comes first.

  ## Book Sale

  The book sale shelf is open for business during regular library hours. Prices are posted. Special sales are planned periodically throughout the course of the school year. Dates and times will be posted.

  ## Re-shelving Books

  Please DO NOT re-shelve any item used. Instead, return all materials to a book cart or leave them on a table or in a study carrel. The library staff will re-shelve all materials after collecting the needed usage statistics.

  ## Book Drop

  During library operating hours, returned items should be left on the Circulation Desk or placed in the book drop inside the library except for RESERVE items. To avoid unwanted overdue charges DO NOT RETURN RESERVE ITEMS TO THE BOOK DROP. An after-hours book drop is located just outside the main entrance of the library and is to be used only when the library is closed. It is OK to place audio-visual materials in the book drop. Items placed in the outside book drop will be counted as having been returned the day the library was last open.

  ## Recalled Items

  The Circulation Manager reserves the right to recall an item that is needed for the support of the current curriculum. If such a request is made, please return the item immediately. Failure to return recalled items within three days will incur a fine of $1.00 per day for a maximum of five days.

  ## Study Carrel Reservation Policy and Procedure

  Study carrel reservations are limited to TMU students only. Reservations will be made for designated study carrels on the second floor and are limited to a period of one week. However, the student may request an extension from the Circulation Manager. Each extension will be considered on a week to week basis.

  The student must also abide by these policies:

  1\. All library materials kept in a reserved carrel must be checked out to the student who is reserving the carrel.

  2\. Reference materials and Periodicals may be used, but not stored at the study carrel. Please place these items on their proper carts after each use.

  3\. The carrel must be kept neat and clean. Personal items are permitted but may not cause an unsightly clutter. The library is not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged personal items.

  4\. Food is not allowed however, drinks are allowed as long as they are in a closed lid container.

  5\. Library resources and personal items must be removed at the termination of the reservation period.

  ## Library Closing

  Due to closing procedures, please have all necessary circulation services completed 15 minutes before closing time (e.g. check out books, return reserved items, return headphones, pay copy charges, etc.).

  ## Emergency Exits

  In addition to the main entrance, there are two emergency exits located on the first floor of the library; one on the east side of the building by the periodical collection and one in the west wing along the connecting wall. Additionally, there is an emergency exit at the rear of the second floor. Please make note of these exits as well as the location of fire extinguishers and plan your exit strategy beforehand. Also, keep in mind that these exits are for emergency use only and an alarm will sound when they are opened.

  ## Fire Alarms

  In the event a fire alarm sounds all patrons are to proceed immediately to the nearest exit; DO NOT attempt to gather personal items. Patrons must obey all directions of the library staff and leave the building immediately. A speedy exit from the building is essential for personal safety and to keep the area clear for responding emergency personnel.

  ## Lost and Found

  The library is not responsible for the safety or security of personal items left unattended in the library (e.g. laptops, cell phones, books, purses, sunglasses, keys, etc.). Personal items found by the library staff will be placed in the "Lost and Found" shelf behind the circulation desk. There they will remain until claimed or the end of the semester. The library staff is not responsible for verifying ownership of lost and found items. Unclaimed items will be discarded at the end of each semester.

  ## [Visitors](http://masters.libguides.com/welcome/libraryvisitors "Visitors")

Powell Library exists to support the academic and scholarly programs of the college with holdings that reflect depth, excellence and diversity; serving to develop knowledge and stimulate thought. The library's focus reflects a commitment to equipping for excellence men and women for service to The Master. Beyond the academic pursuits, the library exists to serve students, alumni and faculty with efficiency, competency and amiability.

  ### A Word About Our History

  The Powell Library for many years served the Los Angeles Baptist College (LABC). Prior to becoming The Master's College (TMC) in 1985 the Los Angeles Baptist Seminary moved to Washington State and removed its portion of the theological collection leaving 25,000 volumes. Since becoming The Master's College the Library has greatly increased its holdings through acquiring the libraries' of George Williams College (1986), the Northeastern Bible College (1991) and the Rev. Karl W. Gillmeister (2004). In addition many individual purchases have been made resulting in a collection in excess of 130,000 print volumes and 266 hardcopy periodicals. With the addition of over 70 subscription online databases and indexing tools, faculty and students have 24/7 access to over 60,000 ebooks, 1,500 ereference books and 35,000 full-text electronic journals. We trust you will find what you need and we welcome any suggestions or improvements you can offer.

  # Circulating Collection

  The library main circulating collection is arranged according to the Dewey Decimal Classification System (DDC) as outlined below. In a given call number, each Dewey Decimal number represents a specific area of knowledge. The Cutter number, a letter/number/letter combination below the DDC number, further identifies the work by the author's surname and the title. For example, the call number for Thomas Watson's The Ten Commandments is as follows:

  241\.52 = Christian moral and devotional theology, codes of conduct

  W338t = "W338" is the numeric value given to the name Watson;

  "t" represents the word "Ten" from the title of the book ("A", "An" and "The" in any language are never considered when they are the first word in a title).

  The .52 is a decimal number and thus is a smaller number than .6 therefore, 241.52 would be shelved before 241.6.

  Exceptions to the use of the DDC are periodicals, which are shelved alphabetically by title and within each title chronologically, oldest to most current (left to right).

  ## Dewey Decimal Classification System

  Note that in the DDC System all areas of knowledge are organized within ten broad classifications using numbers 000 to 999. Approximately one third of the entire TMU Library collection is classed under 200's - Religion. The following is an outline of these ten broad classifications with the ten sub-classifications for religion as well as TMU major related subclasses. For more detailed information on the Dewey System go to [OCLC's DDC 22 Summaries](http://www.oclc.org/dewey/resources/summaries/deweysummaries.pdf).

  ## Locating Library Resources: Solomon

  Solomon, the library's online catalog and database search tool provides location and bibliographic information for all of the resources available in and through the library. Keywords, titles, authors, subjects, or a combination of these may be used in searching Solomon. Solomon also allows patrons to view their own account to find what items they have checked out, check the due date of an item, renew an item and access information regarding any fines/fees owed. The library catalog is available in the library or via the World Wide Web (WWW).

  ## Help in Locating Library Resources

  1\. Type in keywords, titles, authors, subjects or any combination of these to find records related to your search. If you need help ask the reference librarian.

  2\. If the library does not have the item you want, ask. It may be available on request from another library through our interlibrary loan service. See "Services" for details.

  3\. If the book is checked out, you can place a "hold" on the book. The staff will notify you when it comes in. For details on "Hold" policies and procedures go to General Use Policies under Services on the library's Web site.

  ## Reference Collection

  Reference books are generally materials that are consulted for specific information rather than to be read completely through. They include general and specialized encyclopedias, dictionaries, directories, handbooks, yearbooks, atlases, biographical sources and concordances. For a more detailed description of the various types of reference books see "Reference Resources" on the library Web site under Research Guides.

  The hardcopy reference collection is located on the first floor to the right as one enters the library. All reference books have an "R" above the call number and a yellow and red REFERENCE label on their spines. Hardcopy reference materials may not leave the Library.

  Softcopy reference materials on the other hand, are available anytime anywhere to the TMU community of faculty, staff and students. eReference books can be found by searching Solomon.

  ## Reserve Collection

  The reserve collection is located immediately behind the circulation desk at the main entrance. These materials have been set aside by faculty so those students enrolled in a specific course may have access to the information without the added cost of purchasing the items. A few of these items are on strict reserve and may only be read in the Library. Most may be signed out overnight. For details on the library reserve collection policies and procedures go to Course Reserves on the library Web site under Library Services.

  ## Special Collections

  The library maintains several special collections. Some are a collection of materials shelved independent of the main collection; others are materials being collected extensively in a particular subject or by a particular person. Our special collections are listed below.

  Juvenile Books - a collection of fiction and nonfiction books for children located on the second floor.

  Biblical Counseling - an extensive collection is being developed of all the tapes produced by The National Association of Nouthetic Counseling (NANC) as well as books and videos on this subject.

  Creation Science - an extensive collection is being developed of the materials published on the subject of creation science including those produced by ICR (Institute for Creation Research) and CRS (Creation Research Society).

  Karl W. Gillmeister Collection - Upon his death, the heirs of Rev Gillmeister, 1933-2004 donated his entire library of 9,000 volumes to the TMC library. A major portion of this collection is made up of theological works collected over his lifetime. The collection also includes books in the areas of archaeology and art.

  Nell Segraves Creation Science Archives - Nell Segraves' personal collection documenting her efforts and those of Jean Sumrall & Kelly Segraves in presenting the issues of creation science and prayer in public schools before the Supreme Court and the Department of Education.

  Puritanism - an in depth collection of materials by and about puritans and puritanism is being developed covering both the European and American venues.

  TMU Archives - a collection of materials collected over the years revealing the history and development of LABC and TMU. The TMU archives are housed in the MacArthur Legacy Center.

  MacArthur Library - First edition copies of Dr. John MacArthur's published works as well as his original sermon notes and other speaking engagements produced over 25 years of exegeting the WORD of God are archived in the MacArthur Legacy Center.

  ## The Periodical Collection

  The library maintains subscriptions to over 260 hardcopy and 35,000 softcopy magazines, journals and newspapers collectively known as periodicals. To discover specific titles held by this library search the library catalog "Solomon".

  Hardcopy periodicals are arranged on the shelves alphabetically by title and within each title chronologically; oldest to most current, left to right respectively. While hardcopy periodicals do not circulate, they are available for photocopy, scanning and use in the library.

  *Patrons are responsible to abide by copyright laws.*

  The most current issues are located on the display shelves. Back issues for the current year (July to the present) are located behind the sloping shelf displaying the most recent issue. Older back issues (before July) are shelved in the stacks behind the current issues or in a remote storage bin. To obtain issues in remote storage simply tell the Circulation clerk what you need and s/he will retrieve it for you. Newspapers are kept for one week.

  Softcopy periodicals can be identified through Solomon although access to the articles is limited to the TMU community with appropriate id/password.

  ## Indexes to Periodicals

  Indexes are published by numerous organizations at regular intervals. Some cover periodicals of a general nature while others cover specific subjects. In the same way the library catalog indexes the books in the library, periodical indexes provide information on the location of articles contained in various journals, magazines and newspapers. Since scholarly research material usually appears in periodicals before it appears in book form, indexes make available a wealth of valuable, up-to-date scholarly material not otherwise evident.

  Searching the periodical indexes available from the Powell library is done through Solomon. Most of these indexes provide the full-text content of each journal, some only provide abstracts and a few only provide citations. The Interlibrary Loan service may be used to obtain needed articles when the hardcopy or softcopy full-text is unavailable.

  # Giving

  ### Books

  The library will gladly receive donations of books, DVDs, CD's, etc. We reserve the right to keep or dispense of them as best fits our collection development needs. Donations of this kind are tax deductible and the donor is responsible for assigning value. A gift letter that can be used for tax purposes will be given upon request.

  Also, books may be donated to the library by purchasing them through the [Master's University Library Wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html?ie=UTF8&type=wishlist&id=S6N7KD4RBBSA "Master's University Library Wish List") available on Amazon.com.

  In addition, audiobooks are very welcome. Scholars can increase their stewardship of time by multitasking with the help of audiobooks. See Christianaudio.com. Prices vary from $0.50 to $300.

  ## Journal Subscriptions

  Because journals are of little value unless subscriptions are continuously maintained, donations are best given in the form of moneys that can be used to support the collection generally rather than for specific titles. An exception to this is donations made for the purchase of specific issues which are missing from the current collection. If you would like to help us close these gaps within our serials collection please contact the Serials Manager for a list of missing issues (661-362-2272 or toll free 1-800-568-6248).

  ## Money

  Funds may be designated specifically to support The Master's College Robert L. Powell Library. Make check out to The Master's College and indicate it is for the library. All donations are tax deductible.

  ## Electronic Resources

  Online research database are extremely useful to research. Most research databases are available as an annual subscription and these require continuous funding as in the case with journal subscriptions. Moneys donated for the general support of electronic resources are very welcome. In addition, there are some collections of online resources that can be purchased with a one-time fee instead of an annual subscription. Below are those which the library would like to purchase through the generous support of those who are willing and able.

  Gale Virtual Reference Library - individual eReference titles range from $400-$700; collections of 15-20 titles range from $6,000-$10,000. Collections of online reference books from other publisher, like Sage, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Oxford, Cambridge, etc., are similarly priced and would make a wonderful addition to the library's offerings.

  Early English Books Online: 1475-1700 - provides digital access to more than 125,000 literary and historical classics. We need the MARC records so each of these titles is available through the library catalog. Estimated cost - $3,000.

  Web of Science: Science Citation Index and BIOSIS - initial subscription cost is estimated at $18,000-$20,000\+. Annual subscription thereafter is estimated at $9,000-$11,000.
