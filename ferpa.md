    What is FERPA?

    FERPA is an acronym for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g, 34 CFR § 99). Congress enacted FERPA, also referred to as the "Buckley Amendment," in 1974. FERPA conditions federal educational funding on providing student access to, and maintaining the privacy of, education records. Faculty, staff, administrators and other university officials are required by FERPA to treat education records in a legally specified manner.

    Where do I find The Master's College FERPA Policy?

    The University's policy in response to FERPA is *[Student Records Policy: Disclosure of Student Information](#srp)*. The summary information in this tutorial cannot be a substitute for reading The Master's University Student Records Policy.
- body: |-
    Who is protected under FERPA?

    The rights under FERPA apply to eligible students. An eligible student is an individual who is, or has been, in attendance at The Master's University.
- body: |-
    What are a students' rights under FERPA?

    There are primarily seven rights under FERPA. These are the rights:

    * to be informed about educational records;

    * to inspect them;

    * to request an amendment to the records;

    * to challenge the accuracy of the records;

    * to prevent unauthorized disclosure of the records;

    * to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) about a violation of FERPA; and

    * to waive these rights in writing.
- body: |-
    Do parents have any rights?

    When a student is in attendance at the University, the student exercises the rights under FERPA. In elementary and secondary schools, those rights are exercised by the parent.

    FERPA does allow the University to disclose education records to parents of dependent students just as they would to the student. Dependent means a dependent pursuant to the definition under the IRS Code. The Office of the Registrar maintains a record of those students whose parents have provided required documentation that the student is a dependent under the federal tax laws.

    Faculty and staff need to be careful when a parent calls and asks for information about a student. If there is no written waiver by the student or the student is not a dependent, disclosure even to a parent can be unlawful. In these situations, faculty and staff should obtain assistance first from the Office of the Registrar.
- body: |-
    What is an education record?

    The definition of education record under FERPA is broad. It essentially refers to any record that is directly related to a student and that is kept by the University or someone acting on behalf of the University. A record includes information that is recorded in any way, including by computer media. When in doubt, assume that the item, if it relates to a student, is an education record and seek further assistance.

    The terms "student record" and "education record" are often used interchangeably. They are, however, distinguishable under FERPA. For example, as discussed below, some student records are not considered education records and are not subject to FERPA protection.

    Written permission must be obtained from a student before releasing an education record, unless the request fits certain narrow exceptions. The [Student Records Policy ](#srp)summarizes these exceptions.

    One exception, for which written permission from the student is not generally required, is the release of directory information. Directory information is discussed later in this tutorial.
- body: |-
    What is not an education record?

    FERPA has a number of key exceptions to the definition of education records. Those include:

    * Records of the University's Office of Public Safety;

    * Employment records where employment is not connected to student status;

    * Medical and mental health records used only for the treatment of the student;

    * Alumni records that do not relate to the person as a student; and

    * Records made by instructional, administrative and educational personnel not shared with others.

    While some records, like medical treatment records, may not be an education record under FERPA, they are confidential under other provisions of law and professional ethics requirements. Also, if records of the University's Office of Public Safety are shared with others on campus, such as Student Development for disciplinary reasons, they become education records.
- body: |-
    What are some common examples of education records that might exist on a student?

    The University creates or maintains many education records on a typical student. For example, Mary Doe is admitted to The Master's University to complete a B.S. in Elementary Education. Though she has a small financial aid award to cover room and board, she has a work-study job in the Education Department to make ends meet. For her disclosed learning disability, she gets tutoring in the Learning Center, but it does not interfere with her participation on the women's soccer team. A letter she wrote to Student Life about what she learned as the subject of a minor disciplinary charge was considered so incisive that it was shared with Student Life staff via e-mail. When Mary had doubts about whether she was suited for a career in teaching, she met with her academic advisor who took notes and later referred her to the Biblical Counseling Center for help with anxiety. The counselor wrote to Mary's academic advisor to find out if Mary could rearrange her class load. The principal at the school where Mary completed her classroom observations sent a letter to the Dean praising Mary's patient attitude with the students. Mary's grade point average upon graduation was 3.75.

    There are many education records on Mary, found in several different offices: Admissions, Registrar, Financial Aid, Education Department, Student Development, Student Life, Learning Center, Disabilities Services, Campus Ministry, Payroll, Biblical Counseling Center, Athletics, Office of Campus Security, her academic advisor and the principal at the elementary school. Education records about Mary are also stored on the University's e-mail system, and in hard copy in department files.
- body: |-
    What is "directory information"?

    FERPA permits institutions to specifically define some education record information as directory information not confidential under FERPA. This is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.

    The Master's University has defined "directory information" as:

    * Name of student

    * Campus address (building only)

    * Campus phone number

    * The Master's College e-mail address

    * Major field of study

    * Degrees and awards received

    * Dates of Attendance

    * Grade level

    * Enrollment status (i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, graduate)

    * Name of institution last attended

    * Participation in official sports and activities

    * Height and weight of members of athletic teams

    * Photographs (for University use only)

    Note that home address and home phone numbers of a student do not appear on the list of directory information.

    As discussed below, before releasing any directory information, check the computer database or call the Office of the Registrar to see if the student has placed a hold on the release of directory information.
- body: |-
    Can a student refuse to allow directory information to be released?

    Yes. Under FERPA, the University must allow a student to opt out of the release of directory information. Students must complete a form to request that the Office of the Registrar keep all directory information restricted from release. Directory information in a restricted record may not be released without written permission from the student, unless the request for release fits certain exceptions (discussed below). Therefore, faculty and staff need to be careful about assuming that because an item is directory information it can be freely disclosed. If a student has requested to withhold directory information, a note will be placed on his Financial Aid account and also on the Enrollment file indicating restricted access.
- body: |-
    How does a student give specific consent for release of educational records?

    The student can provide a written release giving specific consent to the disclosure of the student's education records. The release needs to be dated and signed and must describe the records, the purpose for the release, list to whom the records can be given and a time for how long the release is effective.

    A faculty member should have a student sign a release before providing a job reference or a reference for the student for certain academic purposes, such as scholarships or awards. The job reference is one area where faculty often forget to obtain a written release.

    Proposed regulations under FERPA specify that a school may accept electronic consents and signatures when reasonable security is provided for the process. Until the amendments become law, an electronic consent is not acceptable because it does not contain the student's signature. Therefore, a faculty member should not consider an e-mail from a student to be a valid consent for release of education records.

    If a record contains personally identifiable information on other students, delete that information before disclosing the record for the student who has provided written consent.

    The Registrar is the University's official responsible for keeping all official academic education records. Only the Office of the Registrar may release an official transcript. All requests for education record information originating from outside the University should be directed to the Office of the Registrar
- body: |-
    When is written consent not necessary?

    FERPA provides many specific exceptions when the University can disclose education records without specific student consent. Many of these exceptions are provided in the regulations to allow for the reasonable and practical workings of an educational institution.

    Some of the most common exceptions include:

    * Disclosure to other school officials within the College whom the College has determined to have legitimate educational interests;

    * Disclosure to officials of another school where the student seeks to enroll;

    * Disclosure in connection with financial aid for which the student has applied;

    * Disclosure to accrediting organizations to carry out their accrediting function;

    * Disclosure to parents of a dependent student, as defined by the IRS Code;

    * Disclosure to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena;

    * Disclosure in connection with a health or safety emergency; it is determined that “there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of the student or other individuals.”

    * Disclosure to military recruiters.
- body: |-
    Who is a "school official"?

    A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position; a trustee or outside contractor such as an attorney or auditor acting as an agent for the University; students or others serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or who is assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.
- body: |-
    What is a "legitimate educational interest"?

    A school official has a legitimate educational interest in the protected education records if the official is:

    * Performing a task that is specified in the official's position description or contract agreement; related to a student's education; or related to the discipline of a student;

    * Providing a service or benefit relating to the student or student's family, such as health care, counseling, job placement, or financial aid;

    * Maintaining the safety and security of the campus.

    Legitimate educational interest does not include simply having a curiosity about the academic record or disciplinary proceedings with regard to a student without some legitimate academic reason. Thus, all records of all students are not open to all faculty or staff at the University.

    Consult with the Office of the Registrar if you have any questions about whether a legitimate educational interest exists in connection with a request for student data.
- body: |-
    What are the sanctions or liability risks for a FERPA violation?

    FERPA provides for a complaint procedure to the United States Department of Education with an ultimate sanction of withholding of federal funding. While there is generally no private cause of action directly under FERPA, students may seek to hold the University or individuals liable under common law tort theories such as invasion of privacy. Faculty, staff, administration or students who violate the University's FERPA policy will be subject to corrective or disciplinary action, depending on the individual circumstances.
- body: |-
    Who can I talk to if I have further questions about FERPA?

    The Office of the Registrar is the first stop for any questions about FERPA or the University's policy (661-259-3540 ext 3689).

    At a minimum, each person on campus who has access to student record information should read the [Student Record Policy](#srp).

    Tips on Managing Student Records \*

    ***\* Adapted from Of Counsel – A Bulletin on Legal Issues at Catholic University of America – November 1997.***

    DO review a copy of The Master's University [Student Records Policy ](#srp)before responding to a request for education records.

    DO NOT release directory information on a student without checking Powercampus/PowerFaids or the Office of the Registrar to see whether the information has been flagged for non-release.

    DO check with the Office of the Registrar before disclosing any student educational record information to third parties outside the institution.

    DO refer all subpoenas or IRS summons or other legal process requests for education records to the Office of the Registrar.

    DO obtain signed, written permission from the student before sharing educational record information, including grades and grade point averages, with parents or others outside the institution. (Exception: a parent who provides the Office of the Registrar a copy of his/her most recent federal income tax return or other evidence of the dependent status of the student may be given access to student record information.)

    DO NOT request information from an education record custodian, or access the student's records by computer, unless you have a legitimate educational interest and are authorized under The Master's University student records policy to access the information.

    DO follow the confidentiality provisions of FERPA by not sharing education records information with your colleagues unless a legitimate educational interest exists.

    DO NOT put purely personal notes (for example, from a committee meeting recommending students for a particular program) in the student's file, because those notes will become accessible to the student. Such records can be kept confidential only if they are kept in the sole possession of the maker and are not accessible or revealed to any other person. Official committee minutes are likely to be considered accessible.

    DO NOT post students' papers, scores or grades in a public place on which names, Social Security numbers, or other personal identifiers are displayed. If posted, use a code known only to you and the student.

    DO remember that medical, mental health, Biblical Counseling and law enforcement records should not be put in the student's file with the student's education records. Medical, Biblical Counseling and mental health records supporting an accommodation for a disability should be forwarded to the Nurse in an envelope marked confidential, and law enforcement records should be kept in the Office of Campus Security.

    DO NOT release information about a student disciplinary matter without conferring with the Vice President for Student Life.

student-record-policy-text: "Student Records Policy:\nDisclosure of Student Information\n\n\nIn
  accordance with the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
  (commonly referred to as FERPA or the \"Buckley Amendment\"), The Master’s University
  and Seminary has adopted this Student Records Policy to protect the privacy of the
  education records of its students. This policy will be published annually and may
  be amended from time to time to conform to the requirements of any changes in the
  governing law. Students will be informed of this policy and any amendments through
  their Master’s University e-mail account.\n\nThe term \"education records\" means
  those records, files, documents, and other materials in handwriting, print, tape,
  film, electronic, or other media that contain information directly related to a
  student and are maintained by The Master’s University and Seminary (TMUS) or a party
  acting for The Master’s University and Seminary. A \"student\" is any person who
  currently attends or has attended TMUS.\n\nTMUS holds various types of education
  records in various locations on campus. The records and their typical locations
  are as follows:\n\n 1. The official education record, which includes TMUS transcript,
  records relating to prior educational experience, and admissions documents, are
  on file in the Office of the Registrar.\n\n 2. Working academic files are maintained
  by deans, department chairpersons, and academic advisers in their respective offices.\n\n
  3. Records related to a student's nonacademic activities are maintained in the Office
  of Student Life.\n\n 4. Records relating to a student's financial status and financial
  aid are maintained in the Office of the Controller and the Student Financial Services
  Office.\n    \n    Education records do not include:\n\n 5. Records created or held
  by instructional, administrative, and educational personnel that are in the sole
  possession of the maker and are not accessible or revealed to any other individual
  except a temporary substitute.\n\n 6. Records of Campus Security.\n\n 7. Employment
  records.\n\n 8. Alumni records that contain information about an individual after
  he or she is no longer a student at TMUS.\n\n 9. Medical or health records made
  and maintained in the course of treatment and disclosed only to those individuals
  providing treatment.\n\n10. Records that contain information about the spiritual
  development of candidates maintained, in addition to basic academic records, by
  seminaries or schools or departments of divinity or theology.\n    \n    \n    Directory
  Information\n    \n    In accordance with the provisions of FERPA, The Master’s
  University and Seminary has the right to provide \"directory information\" without
  the student's written consent. The Master’s University and Seminary currently defines
  \"directory information\" to mean the following:\n    \n    • student name\n    •
  major field of study\n    • dates of attendance\n    • degrees and awards received\n
  \   • grade level\n    • enrollment status (i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate,
  graduate)\n    • name of the most recent previous educational institution attended\n
  \   • participation in official activities or sports\n    • the weight and height
  of members of athletic teams\n    • photographs (but for college use only)\n    \n
  \   In addition, if a person contacts TMUS seeking verification of a student’s date
  of birth, TMUS will only confirm or deny the accuracy of the requestor’s information
  and will not independently disclose the student’s date of birth. \n    \n    Under
  FERPA, students have the right to withhold directory information by notifying TMUS.
  A student must choose to withhold information on the Registration form or present
  a signed letter to the Registrar’s Office specifying what information they do not
  want released. Directory information will be withheld indefinitely unless the request
  to withhold disclosure is revoked in writing at the Registrar's Office.\n    \n
  \   Even if a student has submitted a request to withhold directory information,
  federal law (pursuant to the \"Solomon Amendment,\" effective March 1, 1997) requires
  TMUS to provide address listings for all students, on demand, to any legitimate
  United States military recruiter, without the need to obtain the student's consent.\n
  \   \n    \n    Disclosure of Information\n    \n    The Master’s University and
  Seminary (TMUS) will not disclose personally identifiable information, other than
  directory information, from a student’s education records without the student’s
  written consent, except as follows:\n\n11. To school officials with a legitimate
  educational interest.\n    \n    A \"school official\" is:\n    \n    • A person
  employed by or under contract with TMUS in an administrative, supervisory, academic,
  research, or support staff position\n    \n    • A person serving on the Board of
  Trustees\n    \n    • A person or firm retained by TMUS to perform professional
  services, such as legal services or accounting or auditing services\n    \n    •
  A person or company under contract with TMUS to manage or perform operations functions,
  such as food services, the bookstore, or food and beverage vending.\n    \n    A
  school official has a \"legitimate educational interest\" if the official is:\n
  \   \n    • Performing a task that is specified in his or her position description
  or by a contract \n    \n    • Performing a task related to a student's education\n
  \   \n    • Performing a task related to the discipline of a student\n    \n    •
  Providing a service or benefit relating to the student or student's family, such
  as health care, counseling, job placement, or financial aid\n\n12. To officials
  of other educational institutions in which students seek to enroll\n\n13. To persons
  or organizations providing students with financial aid\n\n14. To accrediting agencies
  carrying out their accreditation functions\n\n15. To authorized representatives
  auditing and evaluating federal and state supported programs\n\n16. To organizations
  or firms conducting studies on behalf of TMUS or other educational institutions\n\n17.
  To either of two parents when at least one parent has established the student's
  status as a dependent according to Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code\n\n18.
  To the legal guardian of a student when the guardian has established the student's
  status as a dependent according to Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code\n\n19.
  To comply with a judicial order or subpoena (and, unless the subpoena is signed
  by a grand jury or issued for law enforcement purposes, the Office of the Registrar
  will make reasonable efforts to notify the student and give the student a minimum
  of 20 business days to legally respond to the order or subpoena)\n\n20. To persons
  in an emergency situation to protect the health or safety of students or other persons\n\n21.
  To persons, as described by state law, serving a juvenile student within the juvenile
  system, who first certify in writing that the information will not be disclosed
  to any other party without the prior consent of the parent/legal guardian or student\n\n22.
  The final results of a disciplinary hearing to an alleged victim of a crime of violence\n\n23.
  The final results of a disciplinary hearing concerning a student who is an alleged
  perpetrator of a crime of violence and who is found to have committed a violation
  of TMUS’s rules or policies\n\n24. To the court in the event of legal action between
  TMUS and the student\n\n25. To a parent or legal guardian when a student under the
  age of 21 has committed a disciplinary violation with respect to the use or possession
  of alcohol or a controlled substance\n    \n    \n    Drug and Alcohol Violations:
  Parental Notification Without Student Consent\n\nThe Dean of Student Life, or designee,
  has the authority to determine when and by what means to notify parents or legal
  guardians, without a student’s consent, when a student under the age of 21 is found
  to have violated any law or TMUS rule or policy related to the possession, use,
  or distribution of alcohol or controlled substances.\n\nThe Dean of Student Life,
  or designee, may delegate to other University or Seminary officials the notification
  of parents or legal guardians. Whenever possible, a student will be informed that
  disclosure to parents is planned in advance of the student’s parent receiving the
  notice.\n\nNothing in these guidelines prevents University and Seminary officials
  from disclosing information in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the
  information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other
  individuals.\n\nConsent to Disclosure of Information\n\nExcept as provided by FERPA,
  a student must provide a signed and dated written consent before TMUS will disclose
  personally identifiable information from the student’s education record. The written
  consent must (1) specify the records that may be disclosed; (2) state the purpose
  of the disclosure; and (3) identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure
  may be made.\n\nRecords of Requests for Disclosure\n\nThe Master’s University and
  Seminary (TMUS) will maintain a record of all requests for or disclosure of information
  from a student's education records, except as provided by FERPA. The record will
  indicate the name of the party making the request, any additional party to whom
  it may be re-disclosed, and the legitimate interest the party had in requesting
  or obtaining the information. The record may be reviewed by the eligible student
  or by his or her parents/legal guardian if the student is a dependent (as defined
  by the Internal Revenue Code). Any third party to whom records were disclosed may
  not release that information to any other party without the student's permission.
  Third parties who disclose information in violation of this standard will be prohibited
  for five years from any further inspection of records at TMUS. \n\nThe recordkeeping
  requirement does not apply when the disclosure is to the student, the student’s
  parent or legal guardian, if the student is a dependent as defined by the Internal
  Revenue Code; a party with written consent from the student; a school official;
  a party seeking directory information; a party seeking records as directed by a
  grand jury or law enforcement subpoena.\n\nInspection and Review of Records\n\nStudents
  may inspect and review their education records on written request to the person
  in charge of the records. That person will comply with the request as soon as reasonably
  possible, but in all events within 45 days after the request has been made, as required
  by law.\n\nStudents have the right to review and inspect all education records in
  their file except:\n\n1. Financial information submitted by their parents;\n\n2.
  Confidential letters and recommendations associated with admissions, honors, employment,
  or job placement to which they have waived their rights of inspection and review
  or which were placed in the file before January 1975;\n\n3. Education records containing
  information about more than one student, in which case the institution will permit
  access only to that part of the record pertaining to the inquiring student;\n\n4.
  Records connected with an application to attend TMUS if that application was denied.\n
  \  \n   If, after inspecting and reviewing their records, students have any questions
  about them, they may request an oral or written explanation and interpretation of
  the records.\n   \n   Students who request a copy of their education records must
  pay a reasonable charge for the copies. No copies of education records will be released
  to a student if the student has an outstanding balance due at The Master’s University
  and Seminary.\n   \n   \n   Right of Complaint\n   \n   Copies of this statement
  and the full text of FERPA are available in the Office of Financial Aid.\n   \n
  \  Students who believe The Master’s University and Seminary is not complying with
  the requirements of FERPA or the regulations issued by the Department of Education
  implementing FERPA may file complaints in writing with:\n   \n   The Family Policy

Welcome to On-Line Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Training

The Master's University is using advances in information technology to enhance teaching and learning, streamline business processes, and improve student services. There is a delicate balance between the responsibility for maintaining student privacy rights and the responsibility for providing effective and efficient service to students. To preserve that balance, it is essential that all members of the campus community who gather, store, access, or use student data understand the legal, ethical, and policy issues related to privacy and the handling of student information.

This process should start with the legal implications of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA is a federal law and is the touchstone of student information privacy practices at The Master's University and other institutions of higher education. The tutorial that follows is designed to prepare authorized members of the campus community to fully understand the responsibilities of handling student record information under FERPA and the College's student records policy:Disclosure of Student Information.

After reading the educational portion of the tutorial, you will be asked to take a short quiz.
