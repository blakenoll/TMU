The things that make The Master’s University so special can’t be experienced on your computer....You’ve got to see it for yourself!  Our beautiful, ranch-style campus nestled in the Southern-California canyon (just 30 miles from Los Angeles) can be experienced via a personal visit for a custom tour, a group visit with your family and friends, or in one of the many open-days. Let us know when you are coming, we're excited to welcome you!
