# March 22-23, 2018: An unforgettable weekend!

The TMU View the U Weekend Experience is an unforgettable opportunity for students to become a Mustang for a few days. Each registrant will experience dorm life, attend classes, chapel, and intercollegiate athletic events, as well as interact with current students and professors.

You will sit under our top faculty in action; a highly qualified team of godly men and women dedicated to cultivating the spiritual and academic potential of our students through personal, one-on-one attention.

* Get first-hand experience staying in the dorms, where friendships are forged.

* Learn more about specific majors and areas of study to discover your passion and develop your calling.

* Worship with your future classmates in Chapel.

* Explore athletics, the music and arts on campus… and of course, the cafeteria!

## Important info for registrants:

All overnight visitors need to bring a sleeping bag and pillow. Any additional overnight evenings in the dorm will cost $10 per night. TMU does not house chaperones or parents in the dorms.

Paid event: $40.00
Additional guests: $10.00

TMU is able to provide airport transportation for students flying unaccompanied into Burbank Airport (BUR) and Los Angeles (LAX). Please contact our coordinator if you have special requests.
