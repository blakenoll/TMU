# View The U

A TMU View Weekend is an unforgettable opportunity for prospective students to experience dorm life and attend classes, chapel services, and intercollegiate athletic events.

You will also be able to see our faculty in action; a highly qualified team of godly men and women who are dedicated to cultivating the spiritual and academic potential of our students through personal, one-on-one attention.

Registration coming soon for March 22-23rd

## Important Information for Registrants:

All overnight visitors need to bring a sleeping bag and pillow. Any additional overnight evenings in the dorm will cost $10 per night. Unfortunately, we cannot house chaperones or parents in the dorms. Please visit our [hotels](http://www.masters.edu/hotels) page to plan overnight housing at a local area hotel.

TMU is only able to provide airport transportation for students flying unaccompanied. If possible, please make all attempts to fly into [Burbank Airport](http://www.burbankairport.com/) (BUR).
