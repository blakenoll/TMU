## Visiting The Master's University

**Come for a preview day...**

If you are a student looking to attend The Master's University, we have several events designed to give you a full picture of life at TMU! We recommend that you attend one of our signature preview events like our one day Mondays@Master's or our extended View Weekend held on select dates throughout the school year! These events are designed to give you a complete picture of what you can expect as a future student at The Master's University and will also provide you with an opportunity to meet with the Admissions team to go over any questions you may have. Find out more about these and other visit opportunities [here](http://www.masters.edu/admissions/#visit)!
