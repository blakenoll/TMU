  How many tests are offered?

  There are 34 separate CLEP examinations. The Master's University offers them all. Since they are on computer, each test is available at every test session.

  ### Tell me about each test. What are the subjects?

  Answers to these questions can be found on the CLEP website at [www.collegeboard.com/clep](http://www.collegeboard.com/clep). View descriptions of each test. You can purchase a copy of the CLEP Study Guide, with sample questions for all tests, or purchase for download sample questions for selected tests.

  ### Who may take the tests?

  The Master's University is an "open" testing location. Anyone can apply to take a test with us.

  ### How do I receive college credit?

  Each college or university sets its own CLEP policy regarding how much credit will be granted and for which courses. Contact the Admissions Office of the concerned college for information on which tests they accept and the score they require for credit. Also ask if there are other additional requirements before credit is granted.

  ### How is the test conducted?

  All CLEP examinations are offered only via a computer workstation. Tests consist of multiple-choice questions (some fill in) and are 90 minutes long, with the exception of College Composition which requires two online essays for a total of 120 minutes.

  ### When can I take a test?

  Tests are offered at 1 pm and 3 pm Monday through Thursday (schedule subject to change). Testing is by appointment only. It is advisable to call for an appointment at least one week before your desired test date.

  ### What does it cost?

  CLEP charges a fee of $80 payable when you take the test (American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover credit card or personal check/money order).This test fee is waived for active duty members of the US military. The Master's University charges a non-refundable and non-transferable $30 administrative fee to non-students (TMC students $15), payable when you reserve your appointment.

  ### Can I take more than one test?

  You may take more than one examination the same day if the testing schedule permits. Charges apply separately to each test. Inform the Administrator when you schedule your tests that you desire to take more than one test.

  ### When do I get my scores?

  You receive your score immediately upon completion of your test. The exception is tests with an essay. Essays are read and graded twice a month. The official transcript of your score will be sent to your institution by CLEP, usually within one week. You may "hold" your score report if you desire by selecting "Do Not Send" on the list of colleges. One transcript recipient may be selected at no cost on the day of testing; transcripts may be sent later at a nominal cost.

  ### Can I repeat a test if I desire to obtain a higher score?

  CLEP policy requires a candidate to wait six months before repeating a test. Consult your college for their policy.

  ### How do I prepare for the test? What do I study?

  CLEP tests are challenging and preparation is strongly recommended. The Master's University does not endorse any particular study methods or material, but see [here](http://www.collegeboard.com/clep "here") for an overview on CLEP preparation.

Also ask if there are other additional requirements before credit is granted.

  ### How is the test conducted?

  DSST examinations are presented through an online system only accessible at the testing center. Each test is designed to be completed in 2 hours. Certain tests permit use of a non-programmable calculator; no other material is allowed in the test room.

  ### When can I take a test?

  Tests are offered at 1 pm and 3 pm Monday through Thursday. This schedule is subject to change. Testing is by appointment only. The Career Services office recommends scheduling your test at least one week in advance to ensure an available computer.

  ### What does it cost?

  DSST charges a fee of $80, which is payable on the date of the test. Payment must be by credit card (Visa, MasterCard or American Express). The test fee is waived for active duty members of the US military. The Master's College charges a non-refundable and non-transferable $30 registration fee, payable at the time an appointment is made.

  ### Can I take more than one test?

  You may take more than one examination the same day if the testing schedule permits. Charges apply separately to each test. Inform the Administrator when you schedule your tests that you desire to take more than one test.

  ### When do I get my scores?

  Test results are reported on the computer at the completion of each test, except the Public Speaking DSST. Results for that test will be mailed to the student and to the institution identified on the test form within five (5) weeks.

  ### Can I repeat a test if I desire to obtain a higher score?

  DSST policy requires a candidate to wait three months before repeating a test. Taking alternate forms of a test title does not change this policy. Any attempts to retest on the same title in less than the specified time will generate an "invalid" score report. This will cause the test-taker to wait an additional 90 calendar days.

  All CLEP examinations are computer-based. Candidates may familiarize themselves with the computer process AND the questions for their particular tests at the CLEP website: [www.collegeboard.com/clep](http://www.collegeboard.com/clep).

  ## When you report for your test, you must bring:

  * Current, valid ID with name, photograph, and signature (example: Drivers License, or US Passport).

  The Master's University will not be responsible for the safety of personal items left unattended during a test. Leave all prohibited items outside the test building.

  A report will be filed with CLEP for anyone found using testing aids during the examination and that person may be excused from completing the examination. Tampering with the computer or using it for any other purpose than the CLEP test is also considered misconduct.

  At the completion of your test, the system will give you an option to cancel or report your scores to the institution you have selected. If you agree to 'send,' ETS will forward your official score report to your designated college within one week. (Exception: The English Composition with Essay is graded twice a month.)
clep-resources-body: |-
  The Master's University Testing Center does not recommend any one study system or resource over any other. The skills and background of each student are unique. Students are encouraged to research available literature and the Internet for possible resources, and then evaluate them with consideration to the student's own level of understanding and preferred study methods.

  Many students have reported that no single study resource prepared them sufficiently for their test, and recommended using two or three different resources.

  The Master's University Testing Center does not endorse or support any of the below resources. They are listed for consideration only. Students should review any material prior to purchasing it to determine whether it adequately covers the material listed in the topical outline in the CLEP Study Guide.

  1. The CLEP Study Guide is a good place to start. This book is available for purchase through CLEP at [www.collegeboard.com/clep](http://www.collegeboard.com/clep). The Guide has a chapter for each of the 35 CLEP tests with test descriptions, knowledge and skills required, outlines of topics covered, additional resources recommended and sample questions. This material is not truly a "study guide" itself as studying this material alone generally will be inadequate. It gives information and direction for further study. All of this material except for the sample questions is available at the CLEP website at no cost. Complete Guides for individual tests which include the sample questions can be purchased online. (TMU students can view all of this material in the Career Office.)

  2. An online study system used by many can be found with the InstantCert Academy at [www.InstantCert.com](http://www.instantcert.com/). For $20 per month, students have access to up to 500 study questions from many (although not all) CLEP tests. This program advertises a 97% success rate and a money-back guarantee if a test is not passed successfully in the first 30 days. [www.IStudySmart.com](http://www.istudysmart.com/) is another fee-based study system.

  3. [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.com/) may be a useful resource.

  4. The Free University Project at [www.freeuniv.com](http://www.freeuniv.com/) has notes and outlines on many of the tests.

  5. SparkNotes by Barnes & Noble at [www.SparkNotes.com](http://www.sparknotes.com/) provides free online study notes for literature, philosophy, chemistry, economics, psychology, math, history and more.

  6. Most major bookstores have an Education Section that carries a number of study guides for various CLEP tests produced by REA, Peterson's and the Princeton Review, among others. These and others may also be found in local libraries as well as at [www.Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) or other online book sellers.

  7. Other resources can be found for free or fee through a [Google search](http://www.google.com/) by entering the specific CLEP test as the search term.

  While most students pass their tests, not all do. Preparation definitely pays off. CLEP tests are intentionally challenging, since they replace an entire semester (or more) of coursework. Study and preparation are strongly recommended!
