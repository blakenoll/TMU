- title: Statement Printing
  slug: statements
  content: 'Statement periods are from the 21st of a month to the 20th of the following
    month. Statements will be sent by the 25th of each month for all accounts that
    have activity during the period or that have a balance (due or credit) at the
    end of the period.

- title: Recieving Financial Aid
  slug: fin-aid
  content: 'Financial aid is applied to accounts as directed by the Office of Financial
    Aid. Should a student become ineligible for financial aid that has been previously
    credited to the account, the amount previously credited will be charged back to
    the account. If the Office of Financial Aid has not received all necessary paperwork,
    they may withhold applying some or all financial aid to the account. Pending financial
    aid does not alleviate the responsibility for making payments. Students with pending
    aid should contact the Office of Financial Aid to resolve any issues prior to
    the payment due date. Otherwise, the statement balance should be paid by the due
    date to avoid a late payment fine. Any outside scholarships and loans will be
    credited to accounts when funds are received. Monthly payments will be adjusted
    after they are applied.

'
- title: Delinquent Accounts Notice
  slug: d-accounts
  content: |
    If a student does not pay the required monthly minimum payment, he/she will receive a notification reminding them of the delinquent payment and his/her student account will be placed on “Stop” by Student Accounts. The stop is a tool used both to track delinquent student accounts and to prevent students from registering for additional classes or making schedule changes.

    Special arrangements may be made if a student is unable to pay according to the prescribed schedule or terms. Such arrangements must be requested in writing to the Student Accounts Office and will not be considered valid unless approved by the Director of Student Accounts.

- question: How do I change my billing address?
  answer: <ol class="browser-default"> <li class="browser-default">Log on to your
    Self-Service Account</li> <li class="browser-default">Click My Profile</li> <li
    class="browser-default">Under my profile, use the “Manage Addresses” feature to
    change your active home or billing address.</li> </ol>
- question: Why is there a charge for medical insurance on my bill?
  answer: <p>All students are required to be covered by medical/accident insurance,
    whether it is through a plan contracted through TMUS or their own. An insurance
    premium will be charged to your account unless you complete an approved waiver
    through the waiver website and mail a copy of the front and backside of your insurance
    card to the Health Center (TMU) or to Academic Records (TMS).</p><p>If you were
    already charged for the TMUS insurance premium, but have personal insurance and
    wish to waive your premium, you may do so by completing the waiver online. &nbsp;If
    you are approved, the charge will be removed. &nbsp;This can be done up to the
    end of add/drop period.</p><p>The policy provided through TMUS covers the student
    from August 1st of the current year through July 31st of the following year (FALL
    premium), or January 1st through July 31st (SPRING only premium). All questions
    about the specific provisions of the plan should be directed to the plan provider.</p><p>Information
    on the plan is available on the <a href="http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/healthservices/"
    title="HealthServices">TMU Health Center website</a>.</p>
- question: How do I view my Student Account on Self-Service?
  answer: '<ol class="browser-default"> <li class="browser-default">Log on to your
    Self-Service Account</li> <li class="browser-default">Click the “Balance” option</li>
    <li class="browser-default">The site will default to a summary of the most current
    term. To view a different term, use the drop down on the left hand side&nbsp;called
    “Period.”</li> <li class="browser-default">You may choose one of the following
    viewing options:<br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Detail by Charges/ Credits</strong>:
    This view provides the details of all transactions marked for the period selected
    as either “charges” or “credits”. Typical charges include tuition, housing, meals,
    and fees. Typical credits include financial aid applied, payments received, or
    reversals of fees.<br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; Detail by Summary Type</strong>: This
    view breaks the charges and credits into their respective summary types, such
    as Tuition, Additional Fees, or Financial Aid. This allows you to look at particular
    categories, such as how many payments were made for the period.<br><strong>&nbsp;
    &nbsp; Balance Summary</strong>: This view summarizes all of the transactions
    viewed in the “Detail by Summary Type” view into single lines, showing the net
    total of each category. This is also the default view.</li> </ol><p><span style="text-decoration:
    underline;"><strong>A Note On "Balance From Other Periods":</strong></span> This
    line&nbsp;shows any balance due (positive) or credit balance (negative) from other
    terms.&nbsp;This balance may include payments intended for the term being viewed,
    but applied to a different semester in our system. This may be due to not having
    a term attached to the payment, or the timing of the receipt of the payment. Because
    TMCS does not bill on a strict “per semester” basis, this should not cause you
    any concern as long as you are current on your payments. Should you have any questions,
    please contact the Student Accounts Office.</p>'
- question: What are my payment options?
  answer: '<p class="boldText"><span>Traditional Undergraduate, Seminary, and Credentialing
    Students</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FULL PAY</span>
    - Students will have the entire balance on their account due by July 10 for the
    Fall semester and December 10 for the Spring semester.&nbsp;If you register after
    the first bill is mailed, your payment will be due the 10th of the following month.</p><p><span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN</span> - Students who
    select the 5 month payment option will have a payment plan fee charged to their
    account and will make 5 monthly payments each semester (July-November for Fall
    semester, December-April for Spring semester). Payments are due on the 10<span>th</span>

    late will have fewer payments.&nbsp; The total balance due will be divided by
    the number of payments that are remaining. This payment schedule is based on registration
    before the first billing (June 20<span>th</span> for the Fall and November 20<span>th</span>
    for the Spring). If you register after these dates, you will pay in 4 months rather

- question: Why was I charged a late fee?
  answer: "<p>A late fee will be assessed to the account if the full payment amount
    due is not received by the dates listed above. A partial payment or payment less
    than the amount due will still be assessed a late fee.</p>"
- question: Why isn’t my financial aid posted to my account?
  answer: <p>Financial aid includes institutional scholarships, federal and state
    financial aid, and federal and private loans.&nbsp; Financial aid is processed
    by the Office of Financial Aid and is awarded and applied according to applicable
    laws and regulations.&nbsp; If you believe you should have aid awarded to your
    account but do not see it listed, please do the following:</p><ol class="browser-default">
    <li class="browser-default"><span>Login on Self-Service and check your Financial
    Aid status under the Finances tab</span>.&nbsp; Missing paperwork may result in
    a delay of the application of financial aid funds or the removal of funds previously
    credited to the student account. Please review this screen to see if you have
    missing documents.</li> <li class="browser-default">If this screen does not list
    the aid you expected, or if all documents are complete and aid is still not applied
    to your account, please contact the Office of Financial Aid for further information.</li>
    </ol>
- question: Can I use my flex bucks next semester?
  answer: "<p>Yes and no! Unused flex bucks from the Fall semester WILL roll over
    to the Spring semester. However, unused flex bucks from the Spring semester WILL
    NOT carry over to the following academic year.&nbsp; Please plan your flex bucks
    usage and purchases accordingly.</p>"
- question: I have a credit balance on my student account.  What can I do with it?
  answer: '<p>If you have a credit balance on your student account (excess of credits
    over charges), you may do any of the following:</p><ol class="browser-default">
    <li class="browser-default">Leave the credit balance on your account for future
    semester charges.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note</span>: &nbsp;We
    are required by the Department of Education to refund you a credit balance created
    by an excess of Federal Student Aid over applicable charges. The refunds will

    are not required to request a refund in this case.</li> <li class="browser-default">Request

    the current semester. If you are a work study student, you may have further restrictions
    on the amount available to refund.</li> </ol>'
- question: How much refund will I get if I drop a class?
  answer: '<p>Refunds are based upon the week that the official withdrawal form, signed
    by the Registrar and the appropriate Dean, is presented to the Student Accounts
    Office, NOT on the time a student ceases to attend classes.&nbsp; A student withdrawing
    from school without consultation or consent of an appropriate administrator will
    not be entitled to any refund.&nbsp; The percentage of tuition refunded is based

    of course or lab materials; these are determined by the academic department and
    are listed on the course information during registration.</p><p><strong>MANDATORY

    to pay directly.&nbsp; If the student is non-responsive or gives permission, the

The Student Accounts Office is responsible for processing student account charges, collecting payments, processing refunds, distributing monthly itemized statements, and providing customer service to the students and families of The Master's University and The Master's Seminary.

Our goal is to provide excellent service in a way that imitates The Master, while ensuring that student account transactions are accurately processed and properly recorded.

We are located in Vider Hall, next to the main administration building on Upper Campus of The Master's University.
