  Welcome to Student Accounts Online Payments

  Online payments can be made by clicking “Make a Payment” below. Clicking this button will take you to our secure payment portal, hosted by Cornerstone Payment Systems. You will need the student's Last Name and Student ID (available on the statement) to process a payment.

  Payments can be made using E-check (ACH) by entering your bank account and routing number. You may also set up recurring payments and save your information for future payments.

general-billing-body: "## How do I make a payment online?\n\nOnline payments can be
  made by clicking “Make a Payment” when logged into Self-Service in the Finances
  tab or by going to [www.masters.edu/payments](http://www.masters.edu/payments).\n\nBegin
  by clicking the \"Make a Payment\" button on the page. Clicking this button will
  take you to our secured payment site. You will need your Student ID number (same
  as Account Number on the statements, ex. 000123456), last name, and bank account
  information. You will receive an auto-generated email receipt for the payment.\n\n###
  How do I change a choice I made during pre-registration?\n\nRegistration preferences
  may be changed by completing a [Registration Change Form](http://www.formstack.com/forms/masters-registration_change_form
  \"TMCS Registration Change Form\").\n\nNOTE: Registration preference changes for
  housing, meals, or student insurance may only be made up through the add/drop period
  for each semester. Any changes made after to this are subject to Student Accounts
  approval and pro-ration of charges.\n\n### How do I change my billing address?\n\n1.
  Log on to your Self-Service Account\n\n2. Click My Profile\n\n3. Under my profile,
  use the “Manage Addresses” feature to change your active home or billing address.\n\n###
  Why is there a charge for medical insurance on my bill?\n\nAll students are required
  to be covered by medical/accident insurance, whether it is through a plan contracted
  through TMUS or their own. An insurance premium will be charged to your account
  unless you complete an approved waiver through the waiver website and mail a copy
  of the front and backside of your insurance card to the Health Center (TMU) or to
  Academic Records (TMS).\n\nIf you were already charged for the TMUS insurance premium,
  but have personal insurance and wish to waive your premium, you may do so by completing
  the waiver online. If you are approved, the charge will be removed. This can be
  done up to the end of add/drop period.\n\nThe policy provided through TMUS covers
  the student from August 1st of the current year through July 31st of the following
  year (FALL premium), or January 1st through July 31st (SPRING only premium). All
  questions about the specific provisions of the plan should be directed to the plan
  provider.\n\nInformation on the plan is available on the [TMU Health Center website](http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/healthservices/
  \"HealthServices\").\n\n### How do I view my Student Account on Self-Service?\n\n1.
  Log on to your Self-Service Account\n\n2. Click the “Balance” option\n\n3. The site
  will default to a summary of the most current term. To view a different term, use
  the drop down on the left hand side called “Period.”\n\n4. You may choose one of
  the following viewing options:\\\n    Detail by Charges/ Credits: This view provides
  the details of all transactions marked for the period selected as either “charges”
  or “credits”. Typical charges include tuition, housing, meals, and fees. Typical
  credits include financial aid applied, payments received, or reversals of fees.\\\n
  \   Detail by Summary Type: This view breaks the charges and credits into their
  respective summary types, such as Tuition, Additional Fees, or Financial Aid. This
  allows you to look at particular categories, such as how many payments were made
  for the period.\\\n    Balance Summary: This view summarizes all of the transactions
  viewed in the “Detail by Summary Type” view into single lines, showing the net total
  of each category. This is also the default view.\n\nA Note On \"Balance From Other
  Periods\": This line shows any balance due (positive) or credit balance (negative)
  from other terms. This balance may include payments intended for the term being
  viewed, but applied to a different semester in our system. This may be due to not
  having a term attached to the payment, or the timing of the receipt of the payment.
  Because TMCS does not bill on a strict “per semester” basis, this should not cause
  you any concern as long as you are current on your payments. Should you have any
  questions, please contact the Student Accounts Office.\n\n### What are my payment
  options?\n\nTraditional Undergraduate, Seminary, and Credentialing Students\n\nFULL
  PAY - Students will have the entire balance on their account due by July 10 for
  the Fall semester and December 10 for the Spring semester. If you register after
  the first bill is mailed, your payment will be due the 10th of the following month.\n\nMONTHLY
  PAYMENT PLAN - Students who select the 5 month payment option will have a payment
  plan fee charged to their account and will make 5 monthly payments each semester
  (July-November for Fall semester, December-April for Spring semester). Payments
  are due on the 10th of each month according to the schedules below:\n\n<table border=\"1\"

  Students who register late will have fewer payments. The total balance due will
  be divided by the number of payments that are remaining. This payment schedule is
  based on registration before the first billing (June 20th for the Fall and November
  20th for the Spring). If you register after these dates, you will pay in 4 months
  rather than 5.\n\nStudents who register for Winterim classes will have the cost
  of the class rolled into their Spring bill.\n\nStudents who register for Post-Session
  classes must pay in full by the first day of class.\n\n### \n\n### Why was I charged
  a late fee?\n\nA late fee will be assessed to the account if the full payment amount
  due is not received by the dates listed above. A partial payment or payment less
  than the amount due will still be assessed a late fee.\n\n### Why isn’t my financial
  aid posted to my account?\n\nFinancial aid includes institutional scholarships,
  federal and state financial aid, and federal and private loans. Financial aid is
  processed by the Office of Financial Aid and is awarded and applied according to
  applicable laws and regulations. If you believe you should have aid awarded to your
  account but do not see it listed, please do the following:\n\n1. Login on Self-Service
  and check your Financial Aid status under the Finances tab. Missing paperwork may
  result in a delay of the application of financial aid funds or the removal of funds
  previously credited to the student account. Please review this screen to see if
  you have missing documents.\n\n2. If this screen does not list the aid you expected,
  or if all documents are complete and aid is still not applied to your account, please
  contact the Office of Financial Aid for further information.\n\n### Can I use my
  flex bucks next semester?\n\nYes and no! Unused flex bucks from the Fall semester
  WILL roll over to the Spring semester. However, unused flex bucks from the Spring
  semester WILL NOT carry over to the following academic year. Please plan your flex
  bucks usage and purchases accordingly.\n\n### I have a credit balance on my student
  account. What can I do with it?\n\nIf you have a credit balance on your student
  account (excess of credits over charges), you may do any of the following:\n\n1.
  Leave the credit balance on your account for future semester charges.\\\n   Note:
  We are required by the Department of Education to refund you a credit balance created
  by an excess of Federal Student Aid over applicable charges. The refunds will be
  automatically sent to the student address on file or to campus mail. You are not
  required to request a refund in this case.\n\n2. Request a refund check be cut from
  your account. You may email us at accountinfo@masters.edu, call our office at 661.362.2212,
  or stop by in person. Please note that we are unable to process refund check requests
  until the add/drop period is over for the current semester. If you are a work study
  student, you may have further restrictions on the amount available to refund.\n\n###
  How much refund will I get if I drop a class?\n\nRefunds are based upon the week
  that the official withdrawal form, signed by the Registrar and the appropriate Dean,
  is presented to the Student Accounts Office, NOT on the time a student ceases to
  attend classes. A student withdrawing from school without consultation or consent
  of an appropriate administrator will not be entitled to any refund. The percentage
  of tuition refunded is based on actual tuition cost charged to the student’s account.\n\nTUITION\n\nTraditional

  / Winterim\n\n100% Refundable if dropped on or prior to first day of class. No refund
  if dropped later than 1st day of class.\n\n\\*Refund schedules subject to change.
  Please refer to your Student Handbook for the most recent information.\n\nROOM AND
  BOARD\n\nRoom and board will be prorated on a weekly basis for traditional programs.
  There will be no room and board refund for Post-Session or Winterim after the first
  day of classes.\n\nCOURSE FEES\n\nCourse fees, lab fees, and individual music lesson
  fees are fully refundable if the student drops the course during the first two weeks
  of class (add/drop period). After this point, they become non-refundable.\n\nTRAD
  STUDENTS IN ONLINE COURSES\n\nUndergraduate students may enroll in online courses
  offered within the fall or spring term up to one week after the start of the course
  and drop with a full refund within the first week. There are no partial refunds
  allowed after the first week. A Traditional Undergraduate student may withdraw (and
  receive a “W”) the 2nd through the 6th week of the course.\n\n### Beside tuition,
  room, and board, what other charges might I see on my bill?\n\nCOURSE / LAB FEES\n\nFees
  are determined by course enrollment. Many courses have additional fees that help
  to offset the cost of course or lab materials; these are determined by the academic
  department and are listed on the course information during registration.\n\nMANDATORY
  FEES\n\nDepending on the program, various student activity, technology, or library
  fees may be included as mandatory fees for the program. These will be clearly defined
  and included in the information provided on cost of attendance.\n\nFINES\n\nFines
  may be assessed for items such as overdue library books, broken equipment, dorm
  room damages, or campus security violations. These fines will be communicated directly
  to the student by the department assessing the fine, and an opportunity provided
  for the student to pay directly. If the student is non-responsive or gives permission,
  the department may choose to transfer these fines to the student account for payment.\n\nQuestions
  about these fines should be directed to the department responsible for assessing
  the fines, as listed below.\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"

  <h3>I registered after the first bill date for my term; when is my first bill due?</h3>\
  <p>Billing statements are run on the 20<span>th</span> of each month, and payment is due by the 10<span>th</span> of the following month. Students who register after the 20<span>th</span> will not receive their first bill until the following next month. However, because classes start before that time, they will still have a payment due.</p>\
  <p> </p>\
  <h3>How do I know how much to pay?</h3>\
  <p>In order to access your amount due, please wait at least a week after your class registration is finalized. At that time, you will need to log onto your Self-Service account, select “Finances” in the menu bar across the top, then click on “Balance”. Select the coming semester from the drop-down menu on the left, and press <strong>Change</strong>. You should see the amounts update to reflect your current charges.</p>\
  <p>If you are using the payment plan for the semester, one-fourth of your balance will be due by the 10<span>th</span>. If you are not using the payment plan, the full balance listed is to be paid by that date. <strong>PLEASE NOTE: Students with overdue accounts after the 10<span>th</span> will be dropped from their classes for the semester.</strong></p>\
  <p> </p>\
  <h3>I dropped a class; how much of a refund will I get?</h3>\
  <p>Refunds are based upon the week that the official withdrawal form, signed by the Registrar and any applicable professors, is presented to the Student Accounts Office, NOT on the time a student ceases to attend classes.  A student withdrawing from school without consultation or consent of an appropriate administrator will not be entitled to any refund.  The percentage of tuition refunded is based on actual tuition cost charged to the student’s account and the schedule below:</p>\

## Billing Information

### Statement Printing

Statement periods are from the 21st of a month to the 20th of the following month. Statements will be sent by the 25th of each month for all accounts that have activity during the period or that have a balance (due or credit) at the end of the period.

### Posting of Financial Aid to Accounts

Financial aid is applied to accounts as directed by the Office of Financial Aid. Should a student become ineligible for financial aid that has been previously credited to the account, the amount previously credited will be charged back to the account. If the Office of Financial Aid has not received all necessary paperwork, they may withhold applying some or all financial aid to the account. Pending financial aid does not alleviate the responsibility for making payments. Students with pending aid should contact the Office of Financial Aid to resolve any issues prior to the payment due date. Otherwise, the statement balance should be paid by the due date to avoid a late payment fine. Any outside scholarships and loans will be credited to accounts when funds are received. Monthly payments will be adjusted after they are applied.

### Delinquent Accounts and Special Payment Arrangements

If a student does not pay the required monthly minimum payment, he/she will receive a notification reminding them of the delinquent payment and his/her student account will be placed on “Stop” by Student Accounts. The stop is a tool used both to track delinquent student accounts and to prevent students from registering for additional classes or making schedule changes.

Special arrangements may be made if a student is unable to pay according to the prescribed schedule or terms. Such arrangements must be requested in writing to the Student Accounts Office and will not be considered valid unless approved by the Director of Student Accounts.
