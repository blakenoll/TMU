  ### Eligibility

  Any student accepted and enrolled full-time at The Master's University who receives a scholarship from their local church is eligible for the Ministry Matching Grant (MMG). Both the church's scholarship and the MMG will be applied directly to the student's account and will be split between the Fall and Spring semesters.

  ### Amount

  The Master's University will match the church's scholarship gift dollar-for-dollar. New ministry-match scholarship recipients for the 2015-16 academic year can receive up to $1,500 per year and ministry match scholarships that students have received in past years will be matched up to the previous year's amount. There is no minimum or maximum amount that a church can give for the scholarship. However, the matching portion from The Master's University will never exceed the stated amount above or the matched amount from a previous year. Please contact the [Office of Financial Aid](mailto:financialaid@masters.edu) for specific questions.

  ### Funding

  Churches can handle their scholarships in a variety of ways. Some churches fund scholarships from their annual budget; others take a special offering. Please visit our Establishing Funds tab below for examples of how to setup and fund your scholarship

  ### Renewal

  Students may receive this matching grant for up to four years. A new Ministry Matching Grant Application must be completed and accompany the church's scholarship each year. If a church decides to award a larger scholarship in a following year, the current year's matching funds from TMU will never exceed the matched funds from a previous year.

  ### Designation

  Only the church can select the students as recipients. Church members, parents, or relatives cannot designate their gifts for specific students. All church contributions must meet IRS guidelines for charitable deductions. To find out more, refer to [IRS publication 526](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Publication-526,-Charitable-Contributions-1).

  ### Deadline

  Both the check and the application must be postmarked no later than August 1st, and both must be received in order to be eligible for the matching grant.

  ### Process

  The process begins with an application. The student's personal information should be completed and then given to the church to completed the remaining portions. Both the check and the application should then be submitted to TMU.

  ### Application

  An application can be retrieved at the Office of Financial Aid or[ ](http://www2.masters.edu/admissions/downloads/MMG_Example.pdf)[downloaded](https://athletics.masters.edu/media/868515/forms-application-mmg.pdf "Forms- Application- MMG.pdf")[ ](http://www2.masters.edu/admissions/downloads/MMG_Example.pdf)from the internet.

  The question most churches have are "How are we going to administer this fund?", or "How do we decide who qualifies for these funds?" We recommend that churches allow their leadership to administrate the awarding of the fund. An example of how this process might work is listed below. Click here to view a sample application that your church could model for your students to apply for your scholarship. This sample gives recommendations for requirements that your church might establish for those who request church funds for higher education. The sample application assumes that the church would have these funds available to multiple Christian colleges and universities; however a church can decide to have funds available for The Master's University only. The scholarship must be available for any church member pursuing higher education, not just specific students.

  ### Example Process

  * Leadership establishes the deadline for applications from students

  * Leadership reviews and discusses those applications that meet all qualifications

  * Leadership decides what amounts and to what colleges they will disburse the scholarship to

  * Leadership fills out the Ministry Matching Grant application and sends the check along with the application

  * The application and check must be received by The Master's University by August 1st

  ### Funding

  There are a variety of ways in which a church can create and fund a church scholarship. The following are a few common options:

  * Create a church scholarship fund line item in the budget for a specified amount and fund it from the general fund. You can establish the fund with a specific amount that remains the same from year to year. In this case, funds would be equally distributed among all applicants. If you choose to have the amount fluctuate based on the number of students in college, money from the general fund would then vary to meet amount designated per student.

  * Create a church scholarship fund line item in the budget and fund it from special giving. Special giving can be fund raisers, special offerings, or direct giving. The church could then distribute the raised funds amount the applicants.

  * Create a church scholarship fund line item in the mission's budget and fund it from the mission's budget in the general fund. The Missions Committee would then decide if all funds come from the mission's budget or a combination of funds from the mission's fund, special offerings, direct giving and/or fund raisers.

  * If you wish to discuss a particular way for the church to establish, administrate and maintain the fund, please feel free to contact Gary Edwards at 661.362.2291 or [gedwards@masters.edu](mailto:gedwards@masters.edu).

### An Investment That's Worth It

The Ministry Matching Grant program provides an opportunity for home churches to continue to invest in the lives of students seeking continued spiritual growth and career preparation. Our shared goals for students provide a partnership that will sustain the student during their time at The Master's University through mutual encouragement, support and accountability. Participation in this program is an investment into the lives of students.

*"Without the Ministry Matching Grant from my church, I would probably not be at TMU right now. It was receiving this grant that made a TMU education possible for me. My church knew that it was important for me to get a good Christian education, and they also knew that TMU was a place I could not only get my degree, but also grow in my faith. I feel so blessed to be here!"*
