The Israel-Bible Extension program, "IBEX", is The Master's University extension program in Israel. IBEX is a 15-week semester abroad program which provides a quality educational opportunity for students who wish to enhance their knowledge of the geographical, historical, archaeological, and cultural understanding of the land of Israel, both ancient and modern. Classroom lectures are integrated with frequent field trips; together, these expose the student to every corner of the land and to every period of the history of the people of that land. The student's educational experience, as well as his or her personal maturation, is significantly enhanced by the cross-cultural experience which the semester-abroad program provides.
