IBEX

The Israel Bible EXtension program, called "IBEX", is The Master's University extension study abroad program in Israel. The IBEX program provides a unique laboratory experience, studying the Bible in the Land of the Bible. This 15-week semester abroad program consists of 13-16 credits and is crafted to meet general education requirements. In addition to the semester-abroad program, other short term Christian study abroad programs are available (see [Programs](http://masters.edu/academics/undergraduate/ibex/programs/) for details).
