  ### Our Philosophy:

  It’s a well-known fact that education is one of the best investments you can make in life. That’s why The Master’s University is committed to providing a first-rate education in an academic environment unashamedly focused on the Christian faith. While the primary burden of providing an education is the responsibility of the student and parents, we are also determined – and able – to provide a substantial package of financial aid to the vast majority of our applicants.
