  Studying kinesiology and physical education at The Master’s University prepares students to work with the human body as members of the body of Christ.\
  \
  At TMU almost every professor serves not only in the classroom, but also on the field working as athletic trainers, daily practicing what’s taught in the classroom — the most up-to-date knowledge and technology available. Students participate in this practical athletic training with Master’s athletes, as well as take hands-on courses in functional anatomy, corrective exercise and assessment techniques. Alongside these courses each student is required to have participated in at least one internship before graduation, many of which have led to careers in Allied Health, coaching, firefighting, physical training, teaching and more. \
  \
  The School of Science, Mathematics & Health boasts of a 95% graduate school acceptance rate, and many alumni boast of their hands-on experience and career preparation that was facilitated through the kinesiology and physical education department.
