  Dedicated to developing lifelong patterns of intellectual growth while also being uncompromising in the faith, the Science Department is committed to producing students who are intellectually competent and an exemplary testimony no matter what discipline they study. Holding firm to the truth and inerrancy of Scripture, The Masterâ€™s University teaches all classes with the unshakeable foundation of the Bible. From Biology (General, Cellular, and Molecular) to Pre-Medical, students will graduate ready to go onto the next step in their field, and defend their faith as an equipped and intellectual worker and break new ground.

  * **Doctrinally sound**: interpreting science through faith rather than faith through science, including teaching a literal six-day creation and a historical Space-Time Fall

  * **Equipping the saints: **students develop an understanding of science wherein their professional, academic and spiritual testimony, the Master is presented and exalted

  * **Small class sizes** means close student-teacher relationships and valuable individual attention

  * **Research opportunities **are ample, both to conduct and present research

  * **Career prospects **in Southern California are diverse and numerous

  * **95% Med-School** acceptance rate

  * **NEW 2018** paleontology and geology. Learn more [here.](/geology)

  \*Most Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) programs are 4-year programs that include pre-nursing. Many Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) programs are post-bachelor (BS) programs. Our pre-nursing program outlined here offers preparation primarily for BS-BSN or BS-MSN post-bachelor degree programs. Some post bachelor nursing programs may require additional courses.
