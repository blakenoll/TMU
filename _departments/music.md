description: The Master’s University equips musicians to glorify God with a program
  that exceeds small-school expectations. Besides its fully equipped facilities, beloved
  and experienced faculty, and continual on-campus performance opportunities, TMU
  is situated in the midst of a rich LA music scene open to participation and enjoyment.
  Each year groups like Chorale perform in venues like Carnegie Hall or St. Peter’s
  Cathedral, and have toured in Israel and Europe. The Music department trains students
  to approach life with a musician’s work ethic and, uniquely, Christian humility.
