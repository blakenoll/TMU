quote:
  I’ve been finished with my Bible classes for over a year now, and there hasn't been a day gone by that I'm not thankful for how great an education I received. . .As much as I have learned from the classes, I have learned so much more from the professors. Their lives as examples of men who want nothing but to serve Christ have been the most impactful thing to me during my time at The Master's University. They have taught me lessons about life and ministry that no book could ever teach, and because of that I will always be indebted to them” (Stevie Noch, ’15)

Standing firm on Christ & Scripture since 1927, there is no better place to study the Bible than at The Master’s University. We hold the Word of God as sufficient in all things, including its own interpretation. To best equip our students for their intended fields, ministry or otherwise, we teach them how to approach the Word; through Greek and/or Hebrew, the context in which it was written, along with a large selection of classes ranging from biblical counseling to the book of revelation.
Our professors are not just equipped scholarly, but are heavily involved in their local church and other ministries; practicing what they teach and standing as examples to each student. With a 10:1 student-teacher ratio, teachers become mentors and friends.
