  Standing firm on Christ & Scripture since 1927, there is no better place to study the Bible than at The Master’s University. We hold the Word of God as sufficient in all things, including its own interpretation. To best equip our students for their intended fields, ministry or otherwise, we teach them how to approach the Word; through Greek and/or Hebrew, the context in which it was written, along with a large selection of classes ranging from biblical counseling to the book of Revelation.

  Our professors are not just equipped scholarly, but are heavily involved in their local church and other ministries: practicing what they teach and standing as examples to each student.

  * Master's is the only campus in the world that offers an entire semester abroad in Israel, which allows students to study the Bible in the land it occurred. Through the \*\*Israel Bible Extension program (IBEX) \*\*a student can earn 15-18 units towards a Bible Minor or Major.

  * A 10:1 student- teacher ratio.

  * One of the first campuses to offer a Biblical Counseling degree, and one of the few to hold to ACBC counseling vs. integrational models.

  * Offers a bi-annual \*\*Turkey & Greece Winter Break Trip\*\*. For only $4,000 current students and alumni study for two week by traveling to ancient sites and places to which Paul addressed his letters.

  * Students in any emphasis will have a working knowledge of Greek or Hebrew, be able to apply hermeneutics to correctly interpret biblical text and understand ministry from a biblical perspective.

quote: "\"I’ve been finished with my Bible classes for over two years now, and there
  hasn't been a day gone by that I'm not thankful for how great an education I received
  . . . As much as I have learned from the classes, I have learned so much more from
  the professors. Their lives as examples of men who want nothing but to serve Christ
  have been the most impactful thing to me during my time at The Master's University.
  They have taught me lessons about life and ministry that no book could ever teach,
  and because of that I will always be indebted to them” (Stevie Noch, ’15)"
