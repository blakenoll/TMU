description: There is a massive need for mathematicians and very few people to help
  fill that gap. The small class sizes are optimal for detailed, personal, and focused
  training in each area. Students majoring in Mathematics at Master’s are challenged
  and strengthened incalculably in their studies to go into any mathematically based
  job and thrive.

  biblical training TMU offers\n\n* Prepares you not only for math but for everyday
  ministry as a vocational mathematician! \n\n* Dr.Button is a member of America and
  the American Mathematical Society, has served as a missionary Englishteacher, and
  serves actively in his local church.\n\n* Dr. Drai graduated from University of
  Nice in France, has worked for NASA, Alcatel Space Industries, and the European

  ## Notes

  1. All students who are interested in going to IBEX should consult their adviser as early as possible.

  2. All students in the Mathematics Education emphasis are strongly urged to take ED400 and ED410 during their last two years, in addition to the courses required for the bachelor’s degree as a preparation for the Teaching Credential Program. Contact the Department of Liberal Studies & Education for more information.

  3. A maximum of two (non-general education) upper division courses from another department may be used to satisfy the “additional upper division mathematics courses” requirement, subject to the prior approval of the student’s adviser.
