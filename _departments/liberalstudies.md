description: The classroom and educational experience for each student, whether they
  are in kindergarten or college, falls largely on the attitude and skill of their
  teacher. To learn from some of the most loving, intellectual, organized, hard-working,
  and wise instructors while being trained to teach yourself is a rare opportunity.
  Students are educated in the methodology behind the classroom, given hands on experience
  in practicing to teach, and have wonderful examples to sit under and watch. The
  influence teachers have on their students is vital for their personal growth. In
  a world that is growing darker and darker, knowing how to be an example of Christ---
  in a secular or religious school--- is an invaluable asset to teachers who want
  to make a genuine impact in young lives.
