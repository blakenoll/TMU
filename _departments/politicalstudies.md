description: Majoring in Political Studies at the Master’s University equips believers
  not only for effective careers in law, politics, or business but also for responsible
  citizenship. Through a biblical framework, professors teach small classes on the
  theory and philosophy of civilizations. This department also allows students to
  participate in a semester long internship in Washington D.C. allowing them a front
  row seat to the inner workings of the government and opportunities for networking.
  Because justice, law, and government originate with God, it is best to study God’s
  purpose for those institutions at an institution where the Bible is preached without
  shame and compromise.
