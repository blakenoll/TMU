Our fall event Engage! will be held October 12-15, 2017. As an extension of the office of Outreach, Engage! is a campus-wide effort of The Master’s University to serve in and learn from churches throughout Southern California. Each year we mobilize approximately 650 student volunteers to serve with local churches in various types of ministry ranging from cross-cultural and urban to homeless and prison outreach.

Engage! is…

### Fellowship

We desire for TMU students to be impacted by local churches' commitment to Christ and His Word as they spend time with ministry leaders and members. We also want to be a source of encouragement to the tireless labors of faithful pastors and churches. We want local churches to know that TMU appreciates them and that their labor is not in vain.

### Evangelism

We long to come along side churches and help fulfill the Great Commission through evangelism. We implore all church partners to send TMU students out to a lost and dying world with the good news of Jesus Christ!

### Service

We wish to cultivate servant hearts by making ourselves available for any service projects that churches may have at their church or in their community.

Engage! is an aid in the spiritual formation of our students and the building of strategic partnerships with local churches. We have students who want to utilize their gifts within a local church, and churches that are looking for assistance with their ministries. Through Engage! we are able to meet both needs and build lasting partnerships in that many of our students make long-term commitments to churches they visit during Engage! and many churches offer our students internship positions. Local churches and communities are exposed to the excellent students we produce and our students are plugged into a local church that prayerfully they can call home while in and even after college.
