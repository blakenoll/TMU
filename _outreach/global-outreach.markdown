support-letter-body: |-
  **This page contains guidelines for writing your support letter. It is recommended that you complete a first draft during the Christmas break. If you want to send out your support letter before Prep for GO begins in January, it is very important that you speak with Lisa La George before you do so!**

  ## **Practical Reasons for Raising Support**

  **The following observations are compiled from People Raising: A Practical Guide to Raising Support by William P. Dillon, pages 3-7:**

  **Participation in support raising…**

  * **…mobilizes a group of people to pray for your ministry.**

  * …enables the missionary to trust God in new and stretching ways.

  * …increases the number of Christians who fund missionary endeavors.

  * …exposes churches and believers to what is happening on the missions 'frontline.'

  * …provides opportunity for the missionary to minister to potential supporters.

  * …opens doors for witnessing to unbelievers.

  ## **A Guide to Composing a Support Letter**

  ### **Step #1: Pray!**

  * **Ask the Lord to build your faith in Him through the process of raising funds for the trip.**

  * Ask for wisdom in how to present the ministry opportunity to other believers.

  * Pray for discernment regarding to whom letters should be sent.

  * Pray for God's bountiful provision and confirmation of His leading you to this mission trip.

  * Ask for the Lord to move people to give and to bless them for their sacrifice.

  * Pray for God to make you humbly dependent on Him through this process.

  ### **Step #2: Determine a mailing list**

  **Start by brainstorming a list of names. Do not exclude anybody who initially comes to mind; you can decide against mailing a letter later on. Use the categories listed below to help you think of potential supporters.**

  * **Avoid determining in your own mind who can and cannot afford to support your trip. Leave this decision to the recipients of your letter.**

  * Next you will need to obtain current information on the people you've added to your list. This may require calling your parents or your church, so plan ahead. Also, pay attention to appropriate titles, making sure that a "Mr." s not substituted for a "Dr." or a "Mrs." for a "Miss."

  * Type up your address information and format for printing on mailing labels.

  **Potential categories of supporters**

  * **Family Contacts**

    * Parents

    * Friends of your parents

    * Uncles and Aunts

    * Cousins

    * Brothers and Sisters

    * Grandparents

    * Parents' friends from high school or college

    * School Contacts

    * Former teachers

    * High school friends

    * Parents of your friends

    * Coaches

    * Professors

    * TMU friends

  * Church Contacts

    * Members of home church

    * Sunday school teachers

    * Youth group leaders

    * Discipleship group leaders/members

    * Friends from youth group

    * Friends from camp

    * Camp counselors

    * Members of a church you formerly attended

  * Employment Contacts

    * Co-workers

    * Former employer(s)

    * Current employer(s)

    * Businesses (some firms offer matching funds)

    * People you babysit for

  * Other Contacts

    * Doctor

    * Dentist

    * Lawyer

    * Haircutter

    * Insurance agent

    * Mechanic

    * Veterinarian

    * Neighbors

    * People who have an interest in the country you're traveling to

    * People who've been to this country before

    * People you've been on other mission trips with

  * Other places to look for ideas

    * Church directory

    * E-mail lists

    * Christmas card list

    * Day timer/palm pilot

  ### **Step #3: Write your first draft**

  **Keep in mind the following goals of your letter as you write:**

  * **…to share your heart's passion for overseas ministry in the coming summer**

  * …to communicate the opportunity for ministry (when, where, who)

  * …to present the opportunity for the recipient to join in this ministry through support

  * …to explain how financial support can be given

  * …to specify ways the recipient can be praying

  **Consider the following tips:**

  * **Keep it brief. People are inundated with mail, even from Christian organizations.**

  * Make it personal. Consider using the mail merge options in your word processor, or type an individual greeting at the beginning of each letter.

  * Spice it up. Add in some pertinent clip art or pictures.

  * Be creative. This letter should be uniquely "you." Don't try to conform to the typical mold. Consider using stationary with a pre-printed, color design.

  ### **Step #4: Revise your letter**

  **Ask other team members and friends to read your letter. Encourage them to check for grammatical and spelling errors, but additionally ask them to evaluate whether the letter graciously expresses your heart.**
missions-resources-body: |-
  The Global Outreach Office receives many inquiries annually as to what resources might be obtained for leading and/or developing a Short Term Missions ministry. Below is a brief annotated bibliography followed by an additional listing of resources which may be of use.

  ## Recommended Resources:

  **Serving with Eyes Wide Open by David Livermore**

  Your passport to learning how short-term missions can best serve Christ's kingdom. Short-term mission trips are great ways to impact the kingdom. Yet they can lack effectiveness because of mistakes or naïveté on the part of participants. In this insightful and timely book, David A. Livermore calls us to serve with our eyes open to global and cultural realities so we can become more effective cross-cultural ministers. Serving with Eyes Wide Open is a must-have book for anyone doing a short-term mission or service project, whether domestic or overseas.

  **The Essential Guide to the Short Term Mission Trip by David C. Forward**

  A helpful and concise guide to the most essential preparatory aspects for a STM. This is the most holistic guide to determining whether to organize a STM all the way through the return. The narrative is easy to read and insightful. Chapters are organized chronologically through the process of leading a STM.

  **Stepping Out: A Guide to Short Term Missions by Tim Gibson, Steve Hawthorne, Richard Krekel, and Kn Moy.**

  A compilation of short articles by numerous facilitators of STM. This is not a step by step guide for leaders but rather provides bite-size chunks of food for thought to team members. Recommended uses include assigning relevant chapters to team members for reading and discussion. Almost all chapters are less than 8 pages in length. Though some of the material is dated (published in 1992), the last section on returning home contains timeless principles for debriefing.

  **A Guide to Short Term Missions by H. Leon Greene**

  The main chapters of this book contain helpful material, but the real benefit of this resource is found in the appendix. The author is a medical doctor with extensive experience on medical ministry trips. His quick reference guide to illnesses, diseases and immunizations is a helpful introduction to the uninitiated lay leader. Overall, this is a good supplemental resource, but not a comprehensive guide as the title indicates.

  **Short-term Missions Workbook by Tim Dearborn**

  A pre-field curriculum for teams to work through individually and as a group. This resource helps a leader prepare a team in cross-cultural communication, team dynamics, and spiritual readiness for the mission ministry. The author does an excellent job of rooting the principles he is communicating in scripture and calling the team member to dig and reflect on his own. Even if not used as a curriculum for a team, STM leaders may find the group exercises for team development and the bible studies fodder for team devotions.

faq-body: |-
  ### What is the priority deadline for applying to join a Global Outreach team?

  December 5

  ### Can I apply for a Global Outreach team after the deadline?

  The priority deadline is December 5, and teams usually fill up before the start of the Spring semester.

  ### Do I need to sign up for the Preparation for Global Outreach class on Thursday nights?

  Each student traveling on a TMU Global Outreach team must register for in the spring semester. Included within the class session is a weekly team time to help plan for your trip abroad.

  ### What kind of credit does the Prep for GO class offer?

  The GO class counts as either an upper division Bible elective or as a cross-cultural general education class. If you take the class as gen ed credits, you will only need to take 3 credits of cross-cultural; the remaining 3 credits of the gen ed requirement can be used for any other class.

  ### Can I take the Preparation for Global Outreach class if I am not a part of a GO trip?

  You may take the GO class even if you are not participating on a GO trip. Your will receive a modified syllabus. TESOL Award members instead should sign up for TESOL.

  ### Do I have to pay tuition fees if BMS 312 adds more than 18 units to my schedule?

  If you wish to take the Prep class for credit, you will register for BMS312 for 3 credits. However, if you do not want the credit, you will register for BMS412 for 0 credits. Either way, the coursework involved must be completed in order to participate on the team.

  ### Can I date or pursue another person on my team?

  The Global Outreach Office does not place dating couples on the same team and discourages any dating relationships during the GO training and trip. If you have concerns about this, please discuss this with your team leader and the GO Director.

  ### I have concerns about my personal security while traveling internationally. Are these trips safe?

  Any international travel carries certain risks. The Global Outreach Office evaluates political, health, and safety risks to potential destinations. We make every effort to inform team members of anticipated risks. Further questions or inquiries about a specific destination can be directed to GO@masters.edu. Should a location become unstable during the training period, the team will either be redirected to another location or, in unusual cases, cancelled.

  ### Do I have to take the GO class again if I have already taken it once?

  Repeat participants will be given a slightly different syllabus to govern assignments and class participation. You must still register for the class, but can only receive the units once.

  ### Can I be on a Global Outreach team if I am studying in IBEX in the spring?

  Sorry, because of the team training, spring IBEX and GO are not possible to accomplish in the same year.

  ### How much do the trips cost?

  The total trip cost, including airfare, food, lodging and ministry expenses will be $3200.

  ### Can someone who is not a current traditional student at TMU join a Global Outreach team?

  Faculty and staff are encouraged to apply for teams. Alumni may be able to participate if spots are available. Questions about this may be directed to GO@masters.edu.

  ### When will I know what team I am on?

  Team rosters will be finalized during the first week of classes in January, however, we will try to notify teams earlier in December if possible.

  ### Is there anything I can do over Christmas break to get ready for a trip?

  Pray.

  Apply for a passport if you don’t already have one. These sites will be helpful: [https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/apply.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/apply.html)[https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/forms.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/forms.html)

  Check in with your family doctor and make sure that your vaccinations are current. If you are not vaccinated against Hepatitis A and B, start the series now--it makes up to 6 months to finish.

  Tell your family and friends that they can give tax deductible donations toward your trip for Christmas. [www.masters.edu/supportGO](http://www.masters.edu/supportgo "Support GO")

  Gather addresses while you are home for people you will send letters to in late January.
engage-body: |2-

  Our fall event Engage! will be held October 12-15, 2017. As an extension of the office of Outreach, Engage! is a campus-wide effort of The Master’s University to serve in and learn from churches throughout Southern California. Each year we mobilize approximately 650 student volunteers to serve with local churches in various types of ministry ranging from cross-cultural and urban to homeless and prison outreach.

  Engage! is…

  ### Fellowship

  We desire for TMU students to be impacted by local churches' commitment to Christ and His Word as they spend time with ministry leaders and members. We also want to be a source of encouragement to the tireless labors of faithful pastors and churches. We want local churches to know that TMU appreciates them and that their labor is not in vain.

  ### Evangelism

  We long to come along side churches and help fulfill the Great Commission through evangelism. We implore all church partners to send TMU students out to a lost and dying world with the good news of Jesus Christ!

  ### Service

  We wish to cultivate servant hearts by making ourselves available for any service projects that churches may have at their church or in their community.

  Engage! is an aid in the spiritual formation of our students and the building of strategic partnerships with local churches. We have students who want to utilize their gifts within a local church, and churches that are looking for assistance with their ministries. Through Engage! we are able to meet both needs and build lasting partnerships in that many of our students make long-term commitments to churches they visit during Engage! and many churches offer our students internship positions. Local churches and communities are exposed to the excellent students we produce and our students are plugged into a local church that prayerfully they can call home while in and even after college.
