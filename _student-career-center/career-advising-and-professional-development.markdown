Earning your degree at The Master’s University is a lifechanging experience, and the knowledge you gain while on this journey can take you far in your post-graduate opportunities. It is the passion of The Master’s University Student Career Center to equip our undergraduates with the experience and skills they need to land successfully in the professional world post-graduation.

Many students grow disheartened when they hear holding a diploma after four years of intensive efforts doesn’t necessarily guarantee them a profitable career. It’s important to be prepared for that reality and fortify your degree with some essential skills and experience that will make you more employable and ready to compete for jobs in a real world that is changing every day.

The Master’s University Student Career Center is on-hand to counsel students through each step of this process and tackle that big, scary question: “So, where do I go next?”

Our staff is on-hand to provide personal support and resources in:

* **General Career Counseling:** Attend multiple career development seminars and workshops with alumni and staff, as well as one-on-one strength and interest assessments provided by TMU!
   

* **Gaining Experience:** We provide many opportunities exclusively available to TMU through which students can secure meaningful and relevant part-time and internship positions to gain valuable, “real-world” experience. 

* **Job Search Strategies:** Craigslist? Monster.com? Indeed.com? Do any of these actually work? 

* **Resumes & Cover Letters:** Get individualized instruction on resume and cover letter writing.

* **Interview Coaching:** Schedule a “mock interview” with the TMU Career Counselor to polish up professional appearance and presence. 

* **Professional Networking:** Create your professional image and learn how to market your skills!
