    *The goal of The Master’s University **Office of Career Services** is to empower students to become dynamic agents of their own professional preparation and career outcomes. We want to help students with the formation of their career plans, which starts with helping them to identify their passions, their competencies, and their aptitudes.*

    *We teach the importance of networking within the business community and take an interactive approach in teaching professionalism in the workplace through one-on-one counseling and workshops. Additionally, we stress the importance that our students master what it requires to customize resumes and write noticeable cover letters, so that they may put their best foot forward in interviews.*

    *It is our pleasure to provide assurance and meaningful assistance to our students here at The Master’s University, and to help propel them into amazing opportunities for future success!*
