    The Master’s University participates in the Federal Work Study program, which helps subsidize our student employees’ wages. This program provides employers in the Santa Clarita Valley with access to an outstanding pool of college-age, part-time employees at a discounted rate.

    We place our student in your business and pay all their payroll taxes, as well as 35% of their hourly wage, which means you only pay 65% of their wage. We view our program as a way to support our community, especially during these difficult economic times. At the same time, it benefits the university, because it helps to provide additional jobs for our students, who have developed a reputation within our community for being hard-working, dependable and reliable.

    **A Brief History**

    The Work Study Program was developed in 1994 to provide students with an opportunity to earn money toward their tuition and to get valuable work experience. It has also become a great opportunity for The Master’s University to reach out to its community through the businesses that participate. The university benefits as well by being able to, in effect, guarantee part-time jobs to prospective students. In this way, the Work Study Program is an effective recruitment and retention tool.

    The Master’s University has over 50 academic programs that draw a diverse student population representing a variety of experiences and skills. We are always looking to partner our students with employers who have similar interests and goals (eg. placing education majors in a local school). Some of our past and current business partners include: public and private schools, manufacturing and retail businesses, corporations and sole proprietorships.

    **The Cost**

    When you hire a TMU Work Study student employee you may set their wage at $11.00 (CA minimum wage) per hour or higher. Your cost is only 65% of the gross wage, which means you pay as low as $7.15 per hour. Employers incur no tax or worker’s compensation liability and avoid the hassle of payroll entry. TMU covers all applicable employer-related taxes, so 65% of the student’s wage is your total cost. Furthermore, an additional discount is available to various local non-profit, government and community-based organizations.

    **Work Study 101**

    Work Study is based on “need” as determined by the FAFSA, and is awarded to undergraduate students through the Office of Financial Aid. Funds are credited toward the student’s bill at the beginning of the semester, and are then earned, or “worked off,” throughout the semester. Work Study is awarded in two amounts, $3,000/yr or $6,000/yr.

    **Scheduling**

    Regular and consistent schedules are preferred; however, flexible scheduling is a possibility, as long as the student can be assured of earning their targeted amount. We ask that any employer choosing to partner with us make enough work available to the student so they can earn their Work Study goal. A student will typically will need to work approximately \
     8 - 20 hours/week to earn their award (depending on their award amount and wage).

    Work Study students are available to work during the school year (September - December and January - May). It is also important to note that though students often are available to work during the day, many will have classes to attend, and may have limited daytime hours.

    **The Payroll Process**

    A Work Study student employee works for you as a contracted employee. The student employee remains on TMU’s payroll so we do all of the processing. Each week your student employee will complete an online timesheet; you, or your representative, must verify the hours.

    TMU will pay the student employee by the hour for the hours submitted on the time sheet. We will then invoice you for 65% of their total pay. Each invoice is due and payable within 20 days of its issue date.

    **Company Requirements**

    Companies must be an officially licensed business, and maintain general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $1 million for each occurrence to be eligible to partner with The Master’s University through the Work Study Program. Companies will also need to be able provide adequate hours for the student to earn their Work Study award.

    **The Registration Process and Finding Employees**

    Company participants who meet the eligibility criteria will sign an Employer Agreement for the length of the academic year. Students are available for hire only twice a year: August and January; the best place to hire student employees is at the Work Study Job Fair, which is held annually in August.

    The office of Student Employment will work on a case-by-case basis to place students with companies mid-year (January).

- title: "II.\tUndergraduate Internships"
  body: |-
    An internship is a limited (usually 2-3 months), one-time work or service experience in a career field, under the supervision of a practicing professional, with a specific learning agenda designed to give a student exposure and experience to prepare the student to enter that field.

    ## **Benefits to Employers:**

    * Interns provide a source of highly-motivated, quality students who have proven to have superior academic skills and personal character.

    * Employers often hire interns for full time positions, having seen their work product and attitude.

    * Students hired from internships tend to have higher performance evaluations and lower absenteeism than the typical new hire.

    * Students who have proven themselves in internships and seek employment in that same field are reported to have greater motivation and a more mature attitude toward their work, with a greater likelihood of rapid career advancement.

    * Employers who participate in internship programs become contributors to the educational process while building positive college relations.

    ## **Benefits to Students:**

    * Students gain a unique inside perspective on their primary career field, and are able to see the relevance of their academic studies to the real world.

    * Students get a head start in their career field and sometimes secure full-time employment upon graduation.

    * Students may earn income to support their college expenses.

    * Students learn job-seeking and job-holding skills, gaining maturity, professionalism and confidence.

    * Internships may be classified as:

    * Paid, or unpaid.

    * For academic credit, or not for academic credit.

    **Paid or Unpaid Internships:** While many companies offer paid internships, not all do. The matter of remuneration is at the discretion of the employer and the student (adhering to the current minimum wage requirements). However, employers should recognize that oftentimes students must leave or decline part-time work in order to participate in an internship. Also, a salary, even a small one, will likely generate greater interest among students. Furthermore, interns often contribute significantly to the company’s operations and are deserving of compensation.

    According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), the average salary for non-technical, undergraduate internships in 2015 was $17.20/hour. Under U.S. Department of Labor standards, an intern may be considered to be a regular employee, and thereby entitled to compensation, unless certain conditions are met. Among those conditions are:

    1. The position is considered as a training experience, like those offered in a vocational school.

    2. The training is for the benefit of the student.

    3. The student dies not displace regular employees, but works under the close supervision of a regular employee.

    4. The employer gains no immediate advantage from the student’s work.

    5. The student is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of training.

    6. The employer and student agree that the student is no entitled to wages for the time spent training.

    **Academic Credit or Not Academic Credit:** Internships that do not involve academic credit may be arranged by the student and the employer. The work may involve as many hours as the student desires. In this case, the internship is identical to a part-time paid or unpaid work position. Internship for which a student is seeking academic credit must be arranged by the student in consultation with his/her academic advisor. The student completes and *Internship Request Form* and, with the academic advisor, determines learning objectives, supervision guidelines, numbers of hours and credit units, and reports/work product to be submitted to the academic advisor.

    The Master’s University recommends that no more than 40% of the work performed by students involved in internships for academic credit consist of routine administrative duties.

    **Best Practices for Internships**

    The National Association of Colleges and Employers has evaluated internship programs and has identified many practices for educational institutions, employers and students that should always be present for a successful internship program:

    The Master’s University recommends that no more than 40% of the work performed by students involved in internships for academic credit consist of routine administrative duties.

    * The student’s experience with the company should emphasize unique job or career related activities that the student could not obtain outside the internship.

    * The employer should inform internal managers and supervisors of the objectives of the internship program and the presence of the intern.


    * The employer should provide of an orientation to the company and the work-site, clarifying internal rules, operation procedures and expectations. Key managers should be introduced, and the intern should receive an overview of the company’s organizational structure.

    * The employer should ensure the intern has regular contact with the designated supervisor, who will complete a performance review at the conclusion of the internship.

    * The employer should identify selection criteria for students, who should compete for the internship as they would a full-time position. This should include a proper resume and a formal interview.
