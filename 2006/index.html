    <p><strong>Sept. 24, 2017:</strong>  At The Master's University, we consider the spiritual and physical well-being of the students under our care to be of the utmost importance. That is why the referenced blog, regardless of whether we disagree with its portrayal, is particularly difficult to read. As with the alleged attack from 2006, it has been and is the practice of The Master's University to both comply with California's mandatory reporting obligations, and also strongly urge all crime victims to make a prompt and full report to the police. We believe those steps were followed in connection with this matter, in addition to the extension of love and concern from our faculty, staff and fellow students. That does not mean, however, that enduring pain and heartache from those events is not genuine. Unfortunately, until the female student provides TMU permission to discuss and/or share her records, we are legally unable to comment on the allegations posted online.  Our prayers go out to those involved, and our best comfort is the certain knowledge that there is healing, peace, forgiveness, and redemption in Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p><em>(Original Statement)</em>
<strong>The ministries of Grace Community Church and The Master’s University and Seminary have been informed of the blog article posted on September 18 by a Ms. Marci Preheim on behalf of an undisclosed individual. Although there are both evidentiary and biblical limitations in dealing with anonymous accusations, we take all claims of misconduct very seriously. According to our initial internal inquiry and review of the available records, we believe the blog article is plainly incorrect, a reality that we have verified with the police report on record. In addition to the various inaccuracies in the posted narrative, the male student that was accused in the official report was never a student at either The Master’s University or Seminary. In our view, anyone who would post such accusations without first verifying them has committed an unconscionable act of defamation, and anyone who would spread such misinformation is equally culpable in that irresponsibility. Should the undisclosed individual or any other person who has direct, firsthand knowledge of this matter wish to address this issue with us, we would request that they contact Kent Haney at The Master’s University who is overseeing the internal review of these allegations.</strong></p>
