## Title IX

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Title IX states that: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.**

## Scope of Title IX

Educational programs and activities that receive ED funds must operate in a nondiscriminatory manner. Some key issue areas in which recipients have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; discipline; single-sex education; student housing; and employment. Also, a recipient may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX. For a recipient to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. For additional policy information on Title IX, please review appendix 6 of the Student Handbook, [here](http://www.masters.edu/media/868274/2016-masters-u-handbook-updated.pdf "2016-masters-u-handbook-updated.pdf")[.](http://www.masters.edu/media/866525/2015-statement-addressing-preventing-and-responding-to-sex-offenses.pdf "2015 Statement Addressing Preventing and Responding to Sex Offenses.pdf")
