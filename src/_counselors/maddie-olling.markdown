I was born and raised in Seattle, fully equipped with a plan to never leave. I stuck closely with my plan and followed my love of pine trees to Spokane, where I attended a small liberal arts school for a year and a half, before transferring to The Master’s University. The summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college, I worked at a summer camp high in the Cascade mountains, where I came to know Jesus Christ as my savior. Soon after, the Lord led me out of my home state to sunny California—which despite my objections, ended up being one of the sweetest gifts the Lord has given to me.

I graduated from The Master’s University in May of 2016 with a B.A. in Biblical Studies, and was offered the opportunity to serve as an admissions counselor the day I walked across the stage, and couldn’t say no! Now I get to tell other Pacific Northwesterners why it’s worth it to leave the rainy states for a few years in California, in return for a world class Bible education and the sweetest community you can find.

Other things about me? I love camp, I love pine trees, I love coffee, I love travel. But mostly, I love learning daily how to conform to the likeness of my Savior by his unending and undeserved grace.
