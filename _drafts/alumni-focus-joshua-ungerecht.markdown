There aren’t many people who can say they are the CEO of multiple companies, but Joshua Ungerecht (’05) can. There are even fewer people who would adamantly defer that glory away from themselves, but Ungerecht does. In an industry full of corruption and selfishness, a man like that stands out.

Joshua is currently either CEO or managing director of five real estate investment companies that steward approximately $1bn in assets under management. He began 11 years ago as an unpaid intern; now 33, he has mastered his craft, though he shies away from the word “mastery” because he knows he will never arrive.

Joshua is and always has been driven. At five years old he remembers becoming angry and tearing up his writing exercises when he made a mistake. At 18 he attended The Master’s University, where he triple-majored in theology, apologetics and missions, and graduated in three years.

He had a dream of serving God on the mission field, but he didn’t want to just become a missionary; he wanted to do the hardest missions work he could find—and die in the process. “It wasn’t that I wanted to die young because I wanted to be like Jim Elliot; I wanted to die young because I was exhausted. I was exhausted from trying to earn God’s favor,” he said.

Several professors saw how hard he was pushing himself and the negative impact his ambition seemed to be having. Drs. Mark Tatlock, Greg Behle, Will Varner and Brian Morley—all Bible Department faculty—took him to lunch and showed him what they were seeing. Joshua said it was not just an intervention of career but of the heart. He realized God’s grace was his to have, unmerited, and that lifted the burden of legalism from his shoulders. He realized his motive for ministry was skewed, and that lifted the burden of seeing vocational ministry as the only viable option for him. 

He was clearly gifted in analytics and critical thinking, and as he spent a year under the mentorship of Dr. Tatlock, his desires changed. Rather than pursuing missions, he turned to academia and began pursuing a Master of Arts in Philosophy from Talbot School of Theology. He never finished.

Joshua graduated TMU in 2005 a married man. He attended Talbot until 2007 and worked as an unpaid due-diligence intern at JRW Investments, a firm specializing in real estate. After a few months on the job, he was spending 80-90 hours a week studying for his profession and owning his responsibilities, having discovered a passion for macroeconomics — he had found his calling. 

As the pressures of life intensified his pursuit of the M.A. fell away. He said, “I realized a large pizza would feed a family better than a philosophy degree.” And what’s more, he identified a huge opportunity outside the academy.

In 2007 The Great Recession began and investment firms took a serious hit, including JRW. Ungerecht stepped up to the plate and asked the partners to appoint him CEO and make him an equal partner. In return he would do everything in his power to keep the company from going under. He became CEO of JRW Investments in the fourth quarter of 2009, the absolute trough of the recession. 

Since then, he has led five companies associated with JRW to accomplish goals that most in his profession only dream of accomplishing. One example: he runs a real estate fund with a yield of more than 20 percent annualized, while most in the industry are happy to find a real estate fund yielding 10-12%.

Joshua’s biggest realization as a businessman was the idea that Christians are called to utilize business as ministry, that there is no divide between the sacred and the secular, no distance between Athens and Jerusalem. He believes this idea can change the world for the sake of the gospel and the glory of Christ.

**A Christian businessman is not defined by Christian fish icons on his business cards, Christian quotes adorning his office or his efforts to evangelize everyone who stops by his desk.** It doesn’t even mean that he simply uses the profits from the business to fund Kingdom ministries. 

> It means that he actively loves the people God has given him to steward at work and does his job with excellence and integrity, completing every task and stewarding every resource for the King of the Universe. 

He doesn’t settle for average; he pursues ideals, even if no one else does. And of course, when given the opportunity, he speaks about the King. In that world, the faith of Jesus Christ is proclaimed not only through the “how” (words and actions) but also in the “why” (motives and inner commitments).

“Business is one ministry where you get the opportunity to love and serve people who are not actively seeking Christ,” Ungerecht explained. “My employees and clients are a stewardship and gift from God and, while God may not always provide profitability for me in business, He always calls me to love the people He has provided… I’m dealing with people’s net worth, and a lot of these people don’t know Christ, so this is the most important thing to them. And they’re entrusting their money to me, a large amount of it. How amazing of an opportunity do I have for the sake of the gospel if I do a ridiculously excellent job on their behalf for the sake of Christ.”

As Ungerecht sees it, the heart of business as ministry has three components. **First,** Christians in business are called to love the people God has entrusted to them (employees, partners, clients). **Second,** they are all called to be on a mission for God; therefore, their primary calling is to be ambassadors of the King, regardless of their ministry (church, parachurch, or business). **Third,** they are all given work to do on this earth that serves others around them and gives them opportunity to be the hands and feet of God. When that service pays an earthly dividend, as it often does in the world of finance, they should give it back to the King.

“People in business should be making as much money as they possibly can, as excellently as possible—they just don’t have to keep it,” Ungerecht said. A Christian businessman or woman must give their business to God, to serve Him in the common grace of work, but they must also give the fruits of their business to doing God’s work.

 “At the end of the day, this world is corrupt. It’s not like we’re going to fix poverty, but that is not an excuse for us not to, in the name of Christ, leverage all of our resources and stewardship. I mean, everything He gives us is ultimately from Him—it’s all His anyway. So we have this opportunity to utilize it for His glory, and for whatever reason out of His grace, He accrues that to our eternal benefit.” 

Anybody in the financial services industry can see Ungerecht’s excellence, from his rise to CEO in a dark time to his stellar performance in the real estate market, and his persistent commitment to his ideals is inspiring. He attributes that excellence to God, but he also gives credit to his alma mater and seeks its continued growth and development. 

“I love the professors of TMU. They shaped me and my wife’s life significantly,” he said. “They love the Lord and they love the students. Katherine and I want to leverage the resources that God has given us to help TMU develop a more robust alumni association that will enhance the encouragement, equipping, and placement of students in the marketplace in a way that will maximize our collective stewardship in Christ.” 

Ungerecht concluded with a challenge: “What has God gifted you with and how can you leverage that to maximize your impact on the world until God calls you home? That is how you’ll find your joy.” 

Perhaps that is the question Dr. Tatlock asked Ungerecht over a decade ago.
