**On Friday, Nov. 10 at The Master’s University, every student and staff member in chapel stood and applauded, shed tears of thankfulness and grabbed their phones to text both parents and friends.** 
	
President John MacArthur announced that tuition for the university will drop by 26 percent in fall 2018, causing the anticipatory audience to erupt. 
	
> “Considering the fact that the (Board) believes the primary barrier to coming here is financial, that the price of tuition next year would be $33,600,” MacArthur explained, “…the board yesterday made an amazingly encouraging decision, unanimously, and that was…to drop the tuition to $24,950.”
	
This announcement of **a more than $8,500 decrease in tuition** follows a year of campus renovations and program enhancements funded by Centers of Excellence, a $25 million campaign dedicated to student scholarships, faculty education, program development and facility upgrades and construction. 

### “This is a great day,” MacArthur said, and the students couldn’t agree more. 

Karen Sanchez, a transfer student from College of the Canyons and second semester sophomore at TMU, expressed her relief: “I don’t have to take out another bank loan, which is such a blessing and so beneficial. You are talking about me being 80 grand out of debt,” she explained, her thankfulness and emotion palpable. “Thank God. I don’t have to fill out all the paperwork for bank loans. I just feel blessed.” 
	
“I believe the Lord is calling me to teach English overseas,” said first semester senior Deborah Grindle. “I have to get a TESOL degree, still have some general education credits I need to fulfill because of units not transferring over from College of the Canyons, and there was no way I was going to be able to finish that in my final semester, let alone come back an additional semester because of the cost. I can do that now if I have to, and this announcement couldn’t have come at a more perfect time.” 

Students texted friends about the announcement, encouraging them to come back to Master’s because it is now financially feasible. The parents of Matthew Logan, class of 2019, celebrated as their son broke the news over the phone. 

“I know one friend was looking at places to transfer last night because of how expensive it was,” another student said. “My friend after chapel expressed how excited she is because, now, that’s no longer the case.” 
	
Dr. Kevin Hill, dean of faculty, expressed his own excitement at the student response. 

“In my class right after chapel, 70 percent of my students had already texted their friends back home telling them they’ve got to come here,” he said. “We are right now at or below the national mean for Christian schools throughout the country and on the low end for Christian schools in California. So that will really open the opportunity for others to come here.” 

> “We would like everyone who would like to be here to have a better shot,” MacArthur concluded in chapel.

**Now they can.**
