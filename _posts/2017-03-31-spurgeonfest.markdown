“I want to mimic what Jake \[Litwin\] said on Monday and thank the Bible Department for allowing me to have this opportunity,” said Nate Youtzy, his deep voice booming as he opened his Spurgeonfest sermon.

According to Pastor John Piper, Charles H. Spurgeon is “considered by many to be one of the greatest preachers since the days of the apostles,” having preached over 600 times before the age of 20. Named in reference to this famous and very quotable preacher, Spurgeonfest is a week that has been set aside annually since the early 1990s to enable senior Bible majors at The Master’s University the opportunity to preach in chapel.

The Biblical Studies Department along with the leadership of Student Life “thought it would be a good idea to have a few senior Bible Majors preach. They do a similar thing at the seminary and we thought we would do the same,” explained Dr. Tom Halstead, chair of the Biblical Studies Department.

Nominated and selected by the Bible faculty based on their achievement in the Sermon Preparation course, reputation in the department and credibility around campus, students consider it quite an honor to speak to their peers and represent the department. The two speakers selected this year? Jake Litwin and Nate Youtzy.

Litwin, a resident assistant in C.W. Smith Hall, spoke Monday using 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 as his text, reminding himself and his audience to not follow the world’s wisdom but be confident in the wisdom of God and His saving gospel.

“Our boasting is in Christ alone,” he said, “because He gives us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption.”

Youtzy, having been guided by his own time in the Word, spoke from Matthew 16:24-28 describing what it looks like to be a disciple of God. Nate plans on continuing his education at The Master’s Seminary this fall.

Both students were encouraged by the eruption of applause and affirmation from their peers as the sermons ended.

They did “an equally fabulous job,” according to Halstead, who continued, “I am so proud of them and thought it couldn’t have been better. That just shows the time and work of our faculty as well. Jake and Nate were good examples for us this year.”
