For several months now, I’ve been peppered with questions about the upcoming election. How can God allow it to come down to these two candidates? Is there a lesser of two evils this time around? And often bluntly, Who are you going to vote for?

My response—and my great comfort as this election cycle comes to a conclusion—is that what happens in America politically has absolutely nothing to do with the kingdom of God.

Think about that—no amount of government influence, corruption, perversion, propaganda, or scandal can derail or disrupt the work of God’s kingdom. No politician or political body can halt the progress of the gospel.

On the other hand, there’s nothing in the world of politics that could make the gospel more efficient or effective, either. The church needs to dispossess itself of the notion that the right president, the right Congress, and the right Supreme Court could set the table for a spiritual revival in America. God’s kingdom is not dependent on human political institutions, nor is it promoted by them. It’s built one soul at a time, according to the Lord’s work through the proclamation of His Word.

That’s not to say that candidates and rulers can’t reflect godly priorities, or ever hope to enjoy His blessing. In fact, Scripture is clear about the leadership characteristics God has promised to bless. Not long ago I preached a sermon called “Who Is God’s Candidate?,” which identified ten fundamental characteristics of God’s candidate—including righteousness, justice, wisdom, honesty, and morality. You can listen to that sermon [here](http://www.gty.org/resources/sermons/90-490/Who-Is-Gods-Candidate-Part-2)

Will we ever see a leader like that? Ultimately, yes, when Christ returns in glory to establish His kingdom. The Psalmist eagerly looked forward to that day. “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations will worship before You” (Psalm 22:27). “All nations whom You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And they shall glorify Your name” (Psalm 86:9). “The nations will fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth Your glory” (Psalm 102:15).

We join with him in the eager anticipation of that glorious day.
