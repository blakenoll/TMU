SANTA CLARITA, CA --- The Master’s University is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. John Stead to the position of Senior Vice President and Provost. With a doctorate from the University of Southern California in the triumvirate of American politics, political theory and comparative politics, Stead has taught at Master’s U as a professor of history and political studies for 47 years, serving as the Vice President for Academic Affairs for over 21 of those years.

University President John MacArthur is “thankful to have John (Stead) move into this role that he is so highly qualified to fill due to his education, history at the university and long-standing commitment to Christ. He is a highly respected educator in the echelons of academia, as well as a favorite of the students with his wisdom and personal interest in their lives.”

Stead is looking forward to working alongside MacArthur, his life-long friend. A witness to much of the university’s history, he remembers the first accreditation in 1975, MacArthur’s inauguration as president when Los Angeles Baptist College became The Master’s College in 1985, and then the institution’s transition to The Master’s University this past year.

“The challenge of continually supporting and strengthening of our faculty and staff, and most importantly, upholding the gospel as the sure foundation of the university is my foremost commitment,” said Stead, speaking to his new role. “Ultimately, there is no university without our beloved students. They are what drives me to help make this a place that honors the gospel by giving them the opportunity for a Christ-centered education, equipping them with a Christian worldview and preparing them to serve in the church, workplace and home.”

This new role for Dr. Stead follows the recent announcement by the university’s Executive Vice President, Dr. Lee Duncan that he will be leaving at the end of this school year to move back into the world of accreditation. Dr. Duncan recently wrote, “I miss being out in Christian schools and teaching them how to use the accreditation process to improve what they are doing. Therefore, after much prayer, I have made the difficult decision to leave TMU to take an opportunity with the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI).” While excited to welcome Dr. Stead as our Provost we are grateful for the leadership and faithfulness of Dr. Duncan during his years at Master’s U.

The university will continue to flourish under the leadership of one of its most-loved professors and administrators. Eager to continue serving the faculty, staff and students, Stead will assume this new role following TMU’s 90th Commencement Ceremony on May 5, 2017.
