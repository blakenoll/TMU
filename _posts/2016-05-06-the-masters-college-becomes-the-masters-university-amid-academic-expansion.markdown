The Master's College and Seminary Board of Directors voted unanimously on May 6, 2016 to change the name of The Master’s College to The Master’s University. The decision comes as a result of increasing academic growth in the school’s undergraduate and graduate divisions as well as the recent launch of numerous online degree programs that have attracted students from all around the world.

“The Master’s College has developed over the years into a first rate educational institution,” said Dr. John MacArthur, president of The Master’s College. “The maturing of the school in its academic status, educational range and quality, as well as the breadth of its degree programs, has elevated Master’s to the highest level of recognition among peer universities. So, it is the time for us to be identified as The Master’s University. For some years we have been qualified for that title, and now is the time for the school to be known for what it actually is – a university. We will continue to faithfully match academic leadership in higher education with unwavering devotion to our Lord Jesus Christ and the inerrant Word of God.”

In the midst of the transition, Dr. MacArthur and TMU’s board reaffirmed the school’s commitment to providing a world-class liberal arts education while incorporating a biblical worldview into each academic discipline. For almost 90 years, The Master’s University has been recognized for its steadfast dedication to a Christ-centered education but has also become widely recognized for its world-class faculty and highly competitive academia. TMU students are consistently outscoring our nation’s leading academic institutions in national testing across various disciplines. In addition to its academic accomplishments, the university has developed highly competitive athletic programs, many of which regularly receive national honors.

TMU alumni are widely recognized as leaders in their chosen vocations demonstrating a foundational understanding of the tools necessary to excel, an ability to work effectively, a strong work ethic, as well as a high level of humility and integrity. This reputation has made its graduates highly desired recruits for employers and top graduate programs worldwide.

The name change has been approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges’ Senior College and University Commission and will become official when TMU completes all of the requirements with the California and U.S. Departments of Education.
