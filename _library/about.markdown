  # Mission & History

  The Lord has provided a rich and growing collection of traditional and electronic resources to support the programs of study at The Master's University. We are excited about making these available to support your spiritual and academic goals. Be assured that our dedicated staff is continually seeking to improve our services and provide a quiet, resourceful and inviting place to study. Please come and let us help you in any way we can. It is our privilege to serve you and contribute as much as possible to helping you develop your studies in a God honoring way. Take a minute and familiarize yourself with the particulars of our library.

  ### Mission Statement

  As the resource, reference and research arm of The Master's University, the Robert L. Powell Library exists to support the academic and scholarly programs of the college with holdings that reflect depth, excellence and diversity; serving to develop knowledge and stimulate thought. The library's focus reflects a commitment to equipping for excellence men and women for service to The Master. Beyond the academic pursuits, the library exists to serve students, alumni and faculty with efficiency, competency and amiability.

  ### A Word About Our History

  The Powell Library for many years served the Los Angeles Baptist College (LABC). Prior to becoming The Master's College (TMC) in 1985 the Los Angeles Baptist Seminary moved to Washington State and removed its portion of the theological collection leaving 25,000 volumes. Since becoming The Master's College the Library has greatly increased its holdings through acquiring the libraries' of George Williams College (1986), the Northeastern Bible College (1991) and the Rev. Karl W. Gillmeister (2004). In addition many individual purchases have been made resulting in a collection in excess of 130,000 print volumes and 266 hardcopy periodicals. With the addition of over 70 subscription online databases and indexing tools, faculty and students have 24/7 access to over 60,000 ebooks, 1,500 ereference books and 35,000 full-text electronic journals. We trust you will find what you need and we welcome any suggestions or improvements you can offer.

  # Circulating Collection

  The library main circulating collection is arranged according to the Dewey Decimal Classification System (DDC) as outlined below. In a given call number, each Dewey Decimal number represents a specific area of knowledge. The Cutter number, a letter/number/letter combination below the DDC number, further identifies the work by the author's surname and the title. For example, the call number for Thomas Watson's The Ten Commandments is as follows:

  241\.52 = Christian moral and devotional theology, codes of conduct

  W338t = "W338" is the numeric value given to the name Watson;

  "t" represents the word "Ten" from the title of the book ("A", "An" and "The" in any language are never considered when they are the first word in a title).

  The .52 is a decimal number and thus is a smaller number than .6 therefore, 241.52 would be shelved before 241.6.

  Exceptions to the use of the DDC are periodicals, which are shelved alphabetically by title and within each title chronologically, oldest to most current (left to right).

  ## Dewey Decimal Classification System

  Note that in the DDC System all areas of knowledge are organized within ten broad classifications using numbers 000 to 999. Approximately one third of the entire TMU Library collection is classed under 200's - Religion. The following is an outline of these ten broad classifications with the ten sub-classifications for religion as well as TMU major related subclasses. For more detailed information on the Dewey System go to [OCLC's DDC 22 Summaries](http://www.oclc.org/dewey/resources/summaries/deweysummaries.pdf).

  ## Locating Library Resources: Solomon

  Solomon, the library's online catalog and database search tool provides location and bibliographic information for all of the resources available in and through the library. Keywords, titles, authors, subjects, or a combination of these may be used in searching Solomon. Solomon also allows patrons to view their own account to find what items they have checked out, check the due date of an item, renew an item and access information regarding any fines/fees owed. The library catalog is available in the library or via the World Wide Web (WWW).

  ## Help in Locating Library Resources

  1\. Type in keywords, titles, authors, subjects or any combination of these to find records related to your search. If you need help ask the reference librarian.

  2\. If the library does not have the item you want, ask. It may be available on request from another library through our interlibrary loan service. See "Services" for details.

  3\. If the book is checked out, you can place a "hold" on the book. The staff will notify you when it comes in. For details on "Hold" policies and procedures go to General Use Policies under Services on the library's Web site.

  ## Reference Collection

  Reference books are generally materials that are consulted for specific information rather than to be read completely through. They include general and specialized encyclopedias, dictionaries, directories, handbooks, yearbooks, atlases, biographical sources and concordances. For a more detailed description of the various types of reference books see "Reference Resources" on the library Web site under Research Guides.

  The hardcopy reference collection is located on the first floor to the right as one enters the library. All reference books have an "R" above the call number and a yellow and red REFERENCE label on their spines. Hardcopy reference materials may not leave the Library.

  Softcopy reference materials on the other hand, are available anytime anywhere to the TMU community of faculty, staff and students. eReference books can be found by searching Solomon.

  ## Reserve Collection

  The reserve collection is located immediately behind the circulation desk at the main entrance. These materials have been set aside by faculty so those students enrolled in a specific course may have access to the information without the added cost of purchasing the items. A few of these items are on strict reserve and may only be read in the Library. Most may be signed out overnight. For details on the library reserve collection policies and procedures go to Course Reserves on the library Web site under Library Services.

  ## Special Collections

  The library maintains several special collections. Some are a collection of materials shelved independent of the main collection; others are materials being collected extensively in a particular subject or by a particular person. Our special collections are listed below.

  Juvenile Books - a collection of fiction and nonfiction books for children located on the second floor.

  Biblical Counseling - an extensive collection is being developed of all the tapes produced by The National Association of Nouthetic Counseling (NANC) as well as books and videos on this subject.

  Creation Science - an extensive collection is being developed of the materials published on the subject of creation science including those produced by ICR (Institute for Creation Research) and CRS (Creation Research Society).

  Karl W. Gillmeister Collection - Upon his death, the heirs of Rev Gillmeister, 1933-2004 donated his entire library of 9,000 volumes to the TMC library. A major portion of this collection is made up of theological works collected over his lifetime. The collection also includes books in the areas of archaeology and art.

  Nell Segraves Creation Science Archives - Nell Segraves' personal collection documenting her efforts and those of Jean Sumrall & Kelly Segraves in presenting the issues of creation science and prayer in public schools before the Supreme Court and the Department of Education.

  Puritanism - an in depth collection of materials by and about puritans and puritanism is being developed covering both the European and American venues.

  TMU Archives - a collection of materials collected over the years revealing the history and development of LABC and TMU. The TMU archives are housed in the MacArthur Legacy Center.

  MacArthur Library - First edition copies of Dr. John MacArthur's published works as well as his original sermon notes and other speaking engagements produced over 25 years of exegeting the WORD of God are archived in the MacArthur Legacy Center.

  ## The Periodical Collection

  The library maintains subscriptions to over 260 hardcopy and 35,000 softcopy magazines, journals and newspapers collectively known as periodicals. To discover specific titles held by this library search the library catalog "Solomon".

  Hardcopy periodicals are arranged on the shelves alphabetically by title and within each title chronologically; oldest to most current, left to right respectively. While hardcopy periodicals do not circulate, they are available for photocopy, scanning and use in the library.

  *Patrons are responsible to abide by copyright laws.*

  The most current issues are located on the display shelves. Back issues for the current year (July to the present) are located behind the sloping shelf displaying the most recent issue. Older back issues (before July) are shelved in the stacks behind the current issues or in a remote storage bin. To obtain issues in remote storage simply tell the Circulation clerk what you need and s/he will retrieve it for you. Newspapers are kept for one week.

  Softcopy periodicals can be identified through Solomon although access to the articles is limited to the TMU community with appropriate id/password.

  ## Indexes to Periodicals

  Indexes are published by numerous organizations at regular intervals. Some cover periodicals of a general nature while others cover specific subjects. In the same way the library catalog indexes the books in the library, periodical indexes provide information on the location of articles contained in various journals, magazines and newspapers. Since scholarly research material usually appears in periodicals before it appears in book form, indexes make available a wealth of valuable, up-to-date scholarly material not otherwise evident.

  Searching the periodical indexes available from the Powell library is done through Solomon. Most of these indexes provide the full-text content of each journal, some only provide abstracts and a few only provide citations. The Interlibrary Loan service may be used to obtain needed articles when the hardcopy or softcopy full-text is unavailable.

  # Giving

  ### Books

  The library will gladly receive donations of books, DVDs, CD's, etc. We reserve the right to keep or dispense of them as best fits our collection development needs. Donations of this kind are tax deductible and the donor is responsible for assigning value. A gift letter that can be used for tax purposes will be given upon request.

  Also, books may be donated to the library by purchasing them through the [Master's University Library Wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html?ie=UTF8&type=wishlist&id=S6N7KD4RBBSA "Master's University Library Wish List") available on Amazon.com.

  In addition, audiobooks are very welcome. Scholars can increase their stewardship of time by multitasking with the help of audiobooks. See Christianaudio.com. Prices vary from $0.50 to $300.

  ## Journal Subscriptions

  Because journals are of little value unless subscriptions are continuously maintained, donations are best given in the form of moneys that can be used to support the collection generally rather than for specific titles. An exception to this is donations made for the purchase of specific issues which are missing from the current collection. If you would like to help us close these gaps within our serials collection please contact the Serials Manager for a list of missing issues (661-362-2272 or toll free 1-800-568-6248).

  ## Money

  Funds may be designated specifically to support The Master's College Robert L. Powell Library. Make check out to The Master's College and indicate it is for the library. All donations are tax deductible.

  ## Electronic Resources

  Online research database are extremely useful to research. Most research databases are available as an annual subscription and these require continuous funding as in the case with journal subscriptions. Moneys donated for the general support of electronic resources are very welcome. In addition, there are some collections of online resources that can be purchased with a one-time fee instead of an annual subscription. Below are those which the library would like to purchase through the generous support of those who are willing and able.

  Gale Virtual Reference Library - individual eReference titles range from $400-$700; collections of 15-20 titles range from $6,000-$10,000. Collections of online reference books from other publisher, like Sage, Taylor & Francis, Springer, Oxford, Cambridge, etc., are similarly priced and would make a wonderful addition to the library's offerings.

  Early English Books Online: 1475-1700 - provides digital access to more than 125,000 literary and historical classics. We need the MARC records so each of these titles is available through the library catalog. Estimated cost - $3,000.

  Web of Science: Science Citation Index and BIOSIS - initial subscription cost is estimated at $18,000-$20,000\+. Annual subscription thereafter is estimated at $9,000-$11,000.
