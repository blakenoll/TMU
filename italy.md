importance-body: The modern world is the child of the Italian Renaissance. All modernist
  worldview issues were first fully formulated in the Renaissance, in both the sciences
  and the humanities. Florence, the city in which TMU in Italy will be based, is the
  cradle of the Renaissance and the birthplace of the modern world. It is the city
  of Dante, Petrarch, Giotto, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Galileo, Boccaccio, Cimabue,
  Brunelleschi and Donatello, the Medici banking family, Botticelli, Savonarola, Machiavelli,
  Rossini. And, of course, Amerigo Vespucci—for whom America was named. With all this
  in mind, we have created a program grounded in the exploration of the dual questions
  “quid est homo?” (“what is Man?”) asked by the Italian Renaissance Christian Humanist
  scholars , and the related biblical question “what is man that Thou art mindful
  of him?” (Psalm 8). .
locations-body: We will be living in a lovely Medieval/Renaissance period villa in
  Florence with trips to Rome, Venice, and Pisa, as well as extensive time spent in
  museums, palaces, classical-era ruins, Renaissance gardens, the Vatican museum and
  libraries, and the famous Mediterranean Coast.
offerings-text: |-
  Our summer semesters are designed to help students graduate on-time, or even early, which means that the GE courses we offer every summer will be determined by the group of students selected and the faculty members who will join the program.

  The typical student will take two survey-level courses and two upper division Oxford-style tutorials. The academically intensive tutorials will have 2-5 students in socratic discussion—and in both the courses and the tutorials the major focus will be an exploratory discussion of Man: his origin, creative nature, purpose and end.

  The following is a SAMPLE list of course offerings:
cost-text: Approximate cost of the program is 10K for airfare, room and board, side
  trips to Italian cities, and tuition for 12 units.
app-process-text: |-
  For each student interested in The Master’s University in Italy Program, we will require a completed application and letters of recommendation, as listed on the application. The deadline for applications for Summer, 2018 is October 31st 2017. Likewise, applications for the following summers will have the same deadline of October 31st.

  Because we receive many applications throughout the year, we recommend that students complete and submit their applications (and recommendation letters) as early as possible. When an application is received and processed, students will receive a confirmation email with further instructions and additional information.
