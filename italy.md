program-description-body: The Master’s University in Italy is a new study abroad program,
  based in incomparably beautiful Italy! Our focus is to provide a unique, deeply
  biblical approach to intellectual history, grounded in the study of the European
  Renaissance and Reformation. Students will live in Florence for six weeks in the
  summer and earn twelve (12) undergraduate credits in a variety of General Education
  courses while deeply immersed in Italian culture and Renaissance history.
importance-body: The modern world is the child of the Italian Renaissance. All modernist
  worldview issues were first fully formulated in the Renaissance, in both the sciences
  and the humanities. Florence, the city in which TMU in Italy will be based, is the
  cradle of the Renaissance and the birthplace of the modern world. It is the city
  of Dante, Petrarch, Giotto, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Galileo, Boccaccio, Cimabue,
  Brunelleschi and Donatello, the Medici banking family, Botticelli, Savonarola, Machiavelli,
  Rossini. And, of course, Amerigo Vespucci—for whom America was named. With all this
  in mind, we have created a program grounded in the exploration of the dual questions
  “quid est homo?” (“what is Man?”) asked by the Italian Renaissance Christian Humanist
  scholars , and the related biblical question “what is man that Thou art mindful
  of him?” (Psalm 8). .
locations-body: We will be living in a lovely Medieval/Renaissance period villa in
  Florence with trips to Rome, Venice, and Pisa, as well as extensive time spent in
  museums, palaces, classical-era ruins, Renaissance gardens, the Vatican museum and
  libraries, and the famous Mediterranean Coast.
offerings-text: |-
  Our summer semesters are designed to help students graduate on-time, or even early, which means that the GE courses we offer every summer will be determined by the group of students selected and the faculty members who will join the program.

  The typical student will take two survey-level courses and two upper division Oxford-style tutorials. The academically intensive tutorials will have 2-5 students in socratic discussion—and in both the courses and the tutorials the major focus will be an exploratory discussion of Man: his origin, creative nature, purpose and end.

  The following is a SAMPLE list of course offerings:
cost-text: Approximate cost of the program is 10K for airfare, room and board, side
  trips to Italian cities, and tuition for 12 units.
app-process-text: |-
  For each student interested in The Master’s University in Italy Program, we will require a completed application and letters of recommendation, as listed on the application.

    ### What should students consider about being exposed to art forms that include nudity?

    *Throughout the Italy program students will be exposed to many forms of art, including representations of the human form. Sometimes, this includes nudity. We understand that in humans’ fallen state, nudity is shameful and can sear a Christian’s conscience. We don’t want to hurt any student’s conscience and if a student thinks he or she will be tempted by the nudity represented in the art all over Italy, then the student should not participate in TMU in Italy. If the student is not sure, the student can meet with Professors Chua and Horner.*

  body: |-
    ### Health Policies

    According to the TMU in Italy Application, students will mark certain medical conditions on the Application. Certain conditions, as guided by the Application, will require the student to consult with their physician as to the feasibility of participation. Those applicants who identify such conditions are required to provide a medical clearance (a doctor's written permission) as a prerequisite to participation in the TMU in Italy program. The TMU in Italy program is physically demanding and may exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions.

    When applying, students will sign a medical release, giving permission to the faculty to select a physician, to hospitalize, to secure proper treatment, to order injections, anesthesia, or surgery for the student in case of an emergency.

    ### Safety Policies

    Students should be aware that the faculty of TMU in Italy are responsible for the students’ safety and will do everything they can to ensure everyone’s safety. Students should also be prepared to foster a culture of safety. Please refer to the [Student Handbook](/handbook) for more student and faculty responsibilities. Students also will sign a Memorandum of Understanding which says the student will adhere to, among other things, safe conduct.

    Students should be aware Italy is an actual place that people live in. Certain things may seem strange and difficult to an American because of cultural differences. Because the program is also an immersive cultural experience, students are expected to show a certain amount of flexibility and a strong sense of personal responsibility. Prior to the start of the program, students will be brief on travel and safety procedures, which will help them navigate through the normal challenges of international travel.
