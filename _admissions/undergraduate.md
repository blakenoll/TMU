  * Personal Statements (Part of Online Application)

    * The Master's University requires two personal statements as part of the application (approx. 300-500 words each), so plan accordingly. Online application can be submitted without personal statements. Statements must then be emailed to [admissions@masters.edu](mailto:admissions@masters.edu) in PDF format to be added to application.

    * Must be completed by non-relative within applicant’s church. Form can be filled out by Head Pastor, Associate Pastor, Youth Pastor, or Elder. Form can be sent directly to pastor from application by inputting the pastor’s email address when requested, otherwise it is the applicants responsibility to email their pastor the link to the form.

  about-body: |-
    I was born and raised in Seattle, fully equipped with a plan to never leave. I stuck closely with my plan and followed my love of pine trees to Spokane, where I attended a small liberal arts school for a year and a half, before transferring to The Master’s University. The summer between my freshman and sophomore year of college, I worked at a summer camp high in the Cascade mountains, where I came to know Jesus Christ as my savior. Soon after, the Lord led me out of my home state to sunny California—which despite my objections, ended up being one of the sweetest gifts the Lord has given to me.

    I graduated from The Master’s University in May of 2016 with a B.A. in Biblical Studies, and was offered the opportunity to serve as an admissions counselor the day I walked across the stage, and couldn’t say no! Now I get to tell other Pacific Northwesterners why it’s worth it to leave the rainy states for a few years in California, in return for a world class Bible education and the sweetest community you can find.

    Other things about me? I love camp, I love pine trees, I love coffee, I love travel. But mostly, I love learning daily how to conform to the likeness of my Savior by his unending and undeserved grace.

  about-body: |-
    I was born in beautiful Southern California, and growing up with the mountains and beach easily accessed in the same day was going to be a hard thing to leave for college. So although I checked out many other schools, TMU was where God had me. I did initially choose the college for its location, but reaped far more benefits in my 4 years there. The truth I learned and Christian world view I developed both grew me then, and continues to impact me now.\
    \
    I spent the first year out of college traveling as much as I could, and the second year at a corporate job. But after all that I am so thankful to now be a part of the Admissions Staff here at TMU. I look forward to helping many students come to a college where they’ll have a blast and learn how to honor Jesus Christ in all aspects of life.

  about-body: |-
    I was raised in the great state of Texas in a wonderful Christian home where I first heard about Master’s as my Dad is an alum of the college. I came to Master’s in 2012 to study biology pre-med and my time here ended up being more life changing than I could have ever imagined. It was during my four years at Master’s the Lord really showed me what it meant to live for Him through the examples of professors, mentors, and friends.

    While at Master’s, along with studying biology, I was a part of the chorale, performed in theater productions, served as an RA in the dorms, and was given to opportunity to travel abroad to countries like Israel, France, Switzerland, Albania, and Croatia! Because of the size of Master’s I was able to utilize all of the resources and learn so much about life. The Lord also gave me brothers and sisters in Christ who I’ll be friends with for the rest of my life!

    My plan is to eventually attend medical school and become and ER doctor; but I also knew I wanted to take some time off and work before starting medical school. When I started looking for jobs, I realized that I wanted to work somewhere I could invest into and really care about what the company or organization stood for. Then I realized, why not work and give back to a place that has already given so much to me? So right now I’m thrilled to be building relationships with students across the country. I love helping bring students to Master’s and watching them have their own fantastic experiences and grow in their knowledge and love of the Lord.

    Request Transcripts

    A transcript is a document that reflects the completion of your secondary school education or the equivalent. Transcripts list the courses you took, the grading scale used, and the grades (marks) you obtained.

    The Master’s University prefers that all transcripts sent to us also be accompanied by an American GPA equivalent (given on a 4.0 scale). This evaluation should be done by a credential evaluation service. If your transcript does not already give a cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale, then please have such an evaluation performed. We suggest the following two evaluators, though others are available. Look for a credential evaluation service that holds an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) membership, to ensure the highest possible accuracy in your transcript evaluation. Please follow the instructions on the evaluators’ websites.

    * [World Education Services](http://www.wes.org/ "WES")

    * [Educational Credential Evaluators](https://www.ece.org/ "ECE")

    All transcripts must be officially translated into English, and bear both the original signature (not a photocopy) of the school official and the official school seal.

    Transfer Students (those who have completed any post-secondary coursework) should also have their college or university transcripts submitted, likewise officially translated into English. Transfer students seeking transfer credit should make sure to have a course-by-course evaluation performed, if needing their transcripts evaluated according to paragraph 2, above.

    Please keep in mind that it may take several weeks for your school to process and mail an official transcript (in addition to the time the transcripts spend in transit, which varies from country to country). Likewise, the evaluation process may also take several days or weeks. Accordingly, please submit your transcripts requests early in the application process.

    All official and evaluated transcripts should be sent to:

    *The Master's University - Office of Admissions *\
    *21726 Placerita Canyon Road *\
    *Santa Clarita, CA 91321 *\
    *USA*

    Submit English Language Test Score

    Your academic success at The Master’s University depends a great deal upon your fluency in the English language. In order to determine your level of proficiency, international applicants must sit for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System).

    The TOEFL is an official exam supervised by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service sends an official report noting your score on the exam to an institution of your choice. You may obtain information about this test at [www.toefl.org](http://www.toefl.org/). When you apply for the test you may have your results sent to The Master’s University by referencing our school code, which is 4411.

    To be considered for admission to The Master’s University, applicants must earn a score of at least 80 on the internet-based (iBT) TOEFL or a 550 on paper-based version.

    IELTS is jointly managed by the British Council, IDT:IELTS Australia, and the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Information about sitting for the IELTS can be found on their web site at [www.ielts.org](http://www.ielts.org/). The Master’s University requires a band score of 6.5 or higher.

    Registration for these exams often must be secured several months in advance. Please plan accordingly.

    Note to Native English Speakers:\
    If you are a native English speaker, you should take either the SAT or ACT, in lieu of the TOEFL or IELTS. Our school code for the SAT is 4411, and for the ACT it is 0303.

    Note to Transfer Students:\
    If you have completed 24 or more semester units of transferable coursework at an accredited American university or college (but not just in an ESL program), the requirements for submitting exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, or ACT) are waived.

    Complete Financial Aid Application

    At the present time, it costs approximately $42,000 (USD) to attend The Master’s University for one year (two semesters), including tuition, housing, and meals. Books, health insurance, and transportation may be extra.

    We are happy to say that—while The Master’s University is not able to give students a full scholarship—we do offer significant funds for qualified international students. We understand that this is a difficult process requiring a great deal of effort and faith. We are praying with you that God’s provision and guidance would be clear to you through this process. Currently, over 90% of our student population receives financial aid! Please note that individual awards cannot be determined until the student has been admitted to the college.

  step4-body: |-
    Finalize Visa Requirements

    Most international students will need an F-1 (student) visa to study at The Master’s University. Once an international student receives his or her acceptance letter and financial aid award package, an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility may be obtained with the assistance of our Designated School Official (DSO). The I-20 can in turn be used to apply for an F-1 visa as a U.S. embassy or consulate. Of course, you as an individual are responsible for obtaining and maintaining a valid passport from your home country.

    Before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility can be issued, the United States Department of State government requires that each international student be able to document his or her ability to afford an education at The Master’s University. Once you have received your financial aid package, you will be asked to submit documentation regarding the remainder of needed funds. This documentation can come from you the student, your family, or any number of sponsors. Each person must fill out, sign, and return the appropriate affidavit of support (see below) with a bank statement or letter from a bank official verifying the availability of funds. Again, we require these documents before we can begin to prepare your I-20, the document that will allow you to apply for an F-1 visa at an American consulate or embassy.

    Please do not submit these forms until you have been notified to do so by the Office of International Student Advancement:

    * [Student/Parent Affidavit of Support Form](http://www2.masters.edu/admissions/downloads/StuParAffidavitofSupport2010.pdf)

    * [Sponsor Affidavit of Support Form](http://www2.masters.edu/admissions/downloads/SponsorAffidavitofSupport2010.pdf)

    Additional information about obtaining and maintaining your visa and/or F-1 student status will be provided once you have been accepted to The Master’s University and have received your financial aid package. In the meantime, general information about applying for a student visa can be found on the U.S. Government’s “Study in the States” website [here](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/).
