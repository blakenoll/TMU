The Graduate Studies department of the Master's University welcomes applications from prospective students who are able to present strong academic records and a clear testimony of faith in Jesus Christ. In selecting students, the graduate admissions committee admits those for whom graduation is a reasonable expectation and who offer potential to contribute positively to the graduate studies community.

### Steps to Apply

To be considered for admission into the graduate studies program, you will need to provide the following application components:

1. [Application for Graduate Admission](https://forms.422x.com/appsynthesis/applicationdata/includes/authentication/logon/logon_start.asp?PID=MastersGrad&AID=207350&EXT=1&EXTID=&REFERER=) (Online)

2. [Application fee](https://masters.formstack.com/forms/graduate_application_fee_credit_card_processing) ($50)

3. [Supplementary personal statements](http://www.masters.edu/media/865705/grad-supplemental-personal-statements-form.pdf)

4. Official transcripts indicating the completion of a bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited college or university

5. Reference forms: [academic](http://www.masters.edu/media/865707/grad-academic-reference-form.pdf), [pastoral](http://www.masters.edu/media/865706/grad-pastor-reference-update-form.pdf) (or other lay-leader), and [personal](http://www.masters.edu/media/865708/grad-personal-reference-form.pdf) (forms provided with application)

6. MABC Applicants Only: Writing sample, a 10-15 page sample of your academic work, demonstrating graduate study capability.

\*Prospective students of the Teaching Credential, Online program, or Seminary programs should consult those departments for application requirements and procedures.

### **Application Deadlines**

**Summer Term **                 \
Domestic: March 1

International: December 15

**Fall Term **\
Domestic: July 1 

International: April 15

Applications may be submitted after the deadline, but we cannot guarantee that they will be given equal consideration with those submitted on time. It is preferred that residential-local students begin studies in a fall term. Because the intensive-modular courses form both the foundation and anchor for the entire distance student's experience, we require distance students to start the program in a summer term. Exceptions are regularly made to this rule for applicants with a strong background in Biblical Studies (for MABS) or Biblical Counseling (for MABC) or for applicants starting their studies with a travel-study course; in such cases, permission for distance students to begin studies in the fall or spring terms is granted.

## Transfer Credits

Credits from other institutions are generally not accepted for transfer due to the unique content and nature of our programs. However, some courses from other theological institutions may transfer with minimal additional coursework. Eligibility for transfer credits is only determined through the transcript review step of the application process.

## International Students

The Master's University is authorized under Federal law to enroll nonimmigrant alien students. Students from abroad are welcome, provided they meet the admission requirements of the College. For applicants, for whom English is a second language, a minimum score of 100 is required on the TOEFL exam in order to be considered for admission. While all classroom instruction is conducted in English, the administration, faculty and staff attempt to be sensitive to the needs of our international students. As foreign students' legal needs are different from those of U.S. citizens, there are additional requirements. Foreign students are urged to contact the [Office of International Student Advancement](mailto:iso@masters.edu "Office of International Student Advancement") to obtain the appropriate information.
