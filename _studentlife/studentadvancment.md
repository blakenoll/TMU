title: Student Advancement
international-students-body: The international community at The Master’s College includes
  over 100 international and third-culture kid (TCK) students from nearly 40 different
  countries. We desire to shepherd these students through their transition to The
  Master’s University, mobilize them toward involvement in all areas of campus, share
  their unique backgrounds with the campus at large, and provide opportunities for
  them to build authentic relationships with one another. Our staff actively promotes
  the spiritual, academic, and social success of these students through a pre-WOW
  orientation, a fall international retreat, service projects, prayer partners, a
  celebration of completion, personal counseling, and other community events.

  The Military Student Advancement Office exists to serve active duty servicemembers, veterans, dependents, and ROTC students who are studying at The Master's University. Our office is staffed by veterans who support our military students by promoting community, Christian fellowship, and by offering encouragement as they transition into student life. Furthermore, we seek to provide opportunities for involvement in all areas of the campus through special events and forums. Our staff is also available to assist students in answering any questions regarding their military educational benefits.

  ## Veterans

  Veterans, as well as their family members utilizing veteran educational benefits, are encouraged to consider The Master's University as their school of choice. The Master's University was recently ranked [No. 20 in Best Colleges for Veterans in the Regional Universities West](http://archive.signalscv.com/archives/156660/).

  The Master's University is approved as a degree-granting institution for the attendance of veterans under Title 38 of the United States Code. This primarily includes the Montgomery GI Bill and Post-9/11 GI Bill, as well as provisions for transfer of entitlement of benefits to spouses or children. The Post 9/11 GI bill applies towards tuition and fees, provides an annual book stipend, as well as a monthly housing allowance. In addition, TMU participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. TMU will contribute up to $10,000 towards tuition per year resulting in 100% coverage of tuition costs.

  ## Active Duty

  Active Duty Servicemembers seeking to take classes from TMU are able to utilize Tuition Assistance (TA) towards our online classes. Currently TMU accepts TA from the Air Force and Army.

  ## ROTC

  The Master's University has developed relationships, or "Cross-Town Agreements," with ROTC detachments at other nearby major state universities. These agreements allow students to attend The Master's University full-time while participating in ROTC at another local school. TMU students participating in ROTC may qualify for competitive scholarships covering up to full tuition.

  ### One-Stop Resource Office

  TMC’s International Ministries Office serves as an important connection point for international students and TCKs, starting at the application stage and continuing through to graduation and beyond. Experienced staff come alongside professors and residence life staff help meet the unique needs of students coming from a variety of cross-cultural backgrounds.

  ## Custom-Tailored Admissions Process

  Several years ago the TMC Admissions Office recognized the benefit of having an admissions counselor specifically dedicated to international students and other TCKs. The [international admissions staff](http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/international/staff.aspx "International Admissions Staff") work with applicants and their families to ensure a smooth application process marked by open and consistent communication, whether a student is applying from Tokyo or Tulsa.

  ## Unique International Orientation Program

  International students, MK’s, and other Third Culture Kids (TCKs) are invited to participate in a strategic orientation program called “Passport to Master’s.” This two-day program takes place prior to the traditional [Week of Welcome](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/campus-ministries/wow-week.aspx "Week of Welcome") (a week-long orientation for all new students). By arriving early, students have the opportunity to discuss specific cultural issues, become acquainted with The Master’s College (TMC) campus, and meet other students from around the globe. Passport to Master’s involves various seminars and activities, and culminates with a special dinner reception for the new students and their family members.

  ## Customized Financial Aid

  It’s becoming harder and harder to find a comprehensive, high-caliber education founded upon a biblical worldview. In light of this, a quality education from The Master’s College has become more valuable than ever. It’s something worth investing in. International students and TCKs have proven to be an asset to the TMC campus and successful representatives of the college in their future endeavors. Consequently, The Master’s College has made a strong commitment to partner with these students and their families in funding this important investment. While TMC cannot provide a full scholarship to students, significant discounts may be obtained. Detailed information about scholarships and grants for international students can be found [here](http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/international/aid.aspx "International Financial Aid").

  ## International Community

  TMC’s International Student Liaisons (ISLs)—part of our core student [Servant Leadership Staff](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/campus-ministries/servant-leadership-staff.aspx "Servant Leadership Staff")—help foster a vibrant community of international students and TCKs on campus. Through regular events and an annual retreat, international students and TCKs find opportunities to connect with each other and develop life-long friendships. Simultaneously, our ISLs help mobilize students to get involved in all areas of campus life: music, sports, leadership, outreach, etc…. The Master’s College does not believe in fostering international student or MK *cliques*—our approach is one of integration and support. In light of this, TMC has intentionally shifted away from offering segregated programs or housing for international students and TCKs.

  ## Missionaries-in-Residence

  Each year The Master’s College hosts a hand-picked missionary family (on furlough) living on campus (this could be you!). Their home—kitchen, fireplace, and all—is available to students who want to stop by. TMC’s [Missionaries-in-Residence](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/global-outreach/missionary-in-residence.aspx "Missionaries in Residence") become a great asset not only to students currently pursuing global missions, but to international students and TCKs who just want to share their own experiences with someone, or seek a bit of extra advice.

  Amy grew up in Southern California and came to TMC to study Business Administration and Management. As a student at Master’s, she was privileged to co-lead Global Outreach teams to Montgomery, Alabama; Albania; and Kosovo. In the future, Amy would like to study for a Master’s in Business Administration, then use business as mission by working overseas or in the inner city.

  ## Fast Facts:

  “To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he is coming witht he clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. 'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.'"
