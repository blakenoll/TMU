title: Student Advancement
international-students-body: The international community at The Master’s College includes
  over 100 international and third-culture kid (TCK) students from nearly 40 different
  countries. We desire to shepherd these students through their transition to The
  Master’s University, mobilize them toward involvement in all areas of campus, share
  their unique backgrounds with the campus at large, and provide opportunities for
  them to build authentic relationships with one another. Our staff actively promotes
  the spiritual, academic, and social success of these students through a pre-WOW
  orientation, a fall international retreat, service projects, prayer partners, a
  celebration of completion, personal counseling, and other community events.

  The Military Student Advancement Office exists to serve active duty servicemembers, veterans, dependents, and ROTC students who are studying at The Master's University. Our office is staffed by veterans who support our military students by promoting community, Christian fellowship, and by offering encouragement as they transition into student life. Furthermore, we seek to provide opportunities for involvement in all areas of the campus through special events and forums. Our staff is also available to assist students in answering any questions regarding their military educational benefits.

  ## Veterans

  Veterans, as well as their family members utilizing veteran educational benefits, are encouraged to consider The Master's University as their school of choice. The Master's University was recently ranked [No. 20 in Best Colleges for Veterans in the Regional Universities West](http://archive.signalscv.com/archives/156660/).

  The Master's University is approved as a degree-granting institution for the attendance of veterans under Title 38 of the United States Code. This primarily includes the Montgomery GI Bill and Post-9/11 GI Bill, as well as provisions for transfer of entitlement of benefits to spouses or children. The Post 9/11 GI bill applies towards tuition and fees, provides an annual book stipend, as well as a monthly housing allowance. In addition, TMU participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. TMU will contribute up to $10,000 towards tuition per year resulting in 100% coverage of tuition costs.

  ## Active Duty

  Active Duty Servicemembers seeking to take classes from TMU are able to utilize Tuition Assistance (TA) towards our online classes. Currently TMU accepts TA from the Air Force and Army.

  ## ROTC

  The Master's University has developed relationships, or "Cross-Town Agreements," with ROTC detachments at other nearby major state universities. These agreements allow students to attend The Master's University full-time while participating in ROTC at another local school. TMU students participating in ROTC may qualify for competitive scholarships covering up to full tuition.
