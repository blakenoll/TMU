title: Student Advancement
international-students-body: The international community at The Master’s College includes
  over 100 international and third-culture kid (TCK) students from nearly 40 different
  countries. We desire to shepherd these students through their transition to The
  Master’s University, mobilize them toward involvement in all areas of campus, share
  their unique backgrounds with the campus at large, and provide opportunities for
  them to build authentic relationships with one another. Our staff actively promotes
  the spiritual, academic, and social success of these students through a pre-WOW
  orientation, a fall international retreat, service projects, prayer partners, a
  celebration of completion, personal counseling, and other community events.
military-student-body: Our Military Resource Office aims to serve students in their
  transition into civilian and student life. Beginning with a unique orientation session
  that works within WOW, we are here to support students by promoting community, fellowshipping
  and offering encouragement as they become familiar with The Master’s University.
  Through special events and forums, we seek to provide opportunities for involvement
  in all areas of the campus. Whether students have served in the military, are serving,
  planning to serve, or involved in a ROTC program, we seek to be a resource during
  their time at TMU. Our office is also available to assist the students in answering
  any questions they may have regarding military educational benefits, such as the
  GI Bill and Tuitions Assistance.
