international-students-body: The international community at The Master’s College includes
  over 100 international and third-culture kid (TCK) students from nearly 40 different
  countries. We desire to shepherd these students through their transition to The
  Master’s University, mobilize them toward involvement in all areas of campus, share
  their unique backgrounds with the campus at large, and provide opportunities for
  them to build authentic relationships with one another. Our staff actively promotes
  the spiritual, academic, and social success of these students through a pre-WOW
  orientation, a fall international retreat, service projects, prayer partners, a
  celebration of completion, personal counseling, and other community events.

  The Military Student Advancement Office exists to serve active duty servicemembers, veterans, dependents, and ROTC students who are studying at The Master's University. Our office is staffed by veterans who support our military students by promoting community, Christian fellowship, and by offering encouragement as they transition into student life. Furthermore, we seek to provide opportunities for involvement in all areas of the campus through special events and forums. Our staff is also available to assist students in answering any questions regarding their military educational benefits.

  ## Veterans

  Veterans, as well as their family members utilizing veteran educational benefits, are encouraged to consider The Master's University as their school of choice. The Master's University was recently ranked [No. 20 in Best Colleges for Veterans in the Regional Universities West](http://archive.signalscv.com/archives/156660/).

  The Master's University is approved as a degree-granting institution for the attendance of veterans under Title 38 of the United States Code. This primarily includes the Montgomery GI Bill and Post-9/11 GI Bill, as well as provisions for transfer of entitlement of benefits to spouses or children. The Post 9/11 GI bill applies towards tuition and fees, provides an annual book stipend, as well as a monthly housing allowance. In addition, TMU participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. TMU will contribute up to $10,000 towards tuition per year resulting in 100% coverage of tuition costs.

  ## Active Duty

  Active Duty Servicemembers seeking to take classes from TMU are able to utilize Tuition Assistance (TA) towards our online classes. Currently TMU accepts TA from the Air Force and Army.

  ## ROTC

  The Master's University has developed relationships, or "Cross-Town Agreements," with ROTC detachments at other nearby major state universities. These agreements allow students to attend The Master's University full-time while participating in ROTC at another local school. TMU students participating in ROTC may qualify for competitive scholarships covering up to full tuition. For a list of our affiliated schools and more information about ROTC, please click [here](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/military-students/rotc/).

  ### One-Stop Resource Office

  TMC’s International Ministries Office serves as an important connection point for international students and TCKs, starting at the application stage and continuing through to graduation and beyond. Experienced staff come alongside professors and residence life staff help meet the unique needs of students coming from a variety of cross-cultural backgrounds.

  ## Custom-Tailored Admissions Process

  Several years ago the TMC Admissions Office recognized the benefit of having an admissions counselor specifically dedicated to international students and other TCKs. The [international admissions staff](http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/international/staff.aspx "International Admissions Staff") work with applicants and their families to ensure a smooth application process marked by open and consistent communication, whether a student is applying from Tokyo or Tulsa.

  ## Unique International Orientation Program

  International students, MK’s, and other Third Culture Kids (TCKs) are invited to participate in a strategic orientation program called “Passport to Master’s.” This two-day program takes place prior to the traditional [Week of Welcome](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/campus-ministries/wow-week.aspx "Week of Welcome") (a week-long orientation for all new students). By arriving early, students have the opportunity to discuss specific cultural issues, become acquainted with The Master’s College (TMC) campus, and meet other students from around the globe. Passport to Master’s involves various seminars and activities, and culminates with a special dinner reception for the new students and their family members.

  ## Customized Financial Aid

  It’s becoming harder and harder to find a comprehensive, high-caliber education founded upon a biblical worldview. In light of this, a quality education from The Master’s College has become more valuable than ever. It’s something worth investing in. International students and TCKs have proven to be an asset to the TMC campus and successful representatives of the college in their future endeavors. Consequently, The Master’s College has made a strong commitment to partner with these students and their families in funding this important investment. While TMC cannot provide a full scholarship to students, significant discounts may be obtained. Detailed information about scholarships and grants for international students can be found [here](http://www.masters.edu/undergrad/international/aid.aspx "International Financial Aid").

  ## International Community

  TMC’s International Student Liaisons (ISLs)—part of our core student [Servant Leadership Staff](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/campus-ministries/servant-leadership-staff.aspx "Servant Leadership Staff")—help foster a vibrant community of international students and TCKs on campus. Through regular events and an annual retreat, international students and TCKs find opportunities to connect with each other and develop life-long friendships. Simultaneously, our ISLs help mobilize students to get involved in all areas of campus life: music, sports, leadership, outreach, etc…. The Master’s College does not believe in fostering international student or MK *cliques*—our approach is one of integration and support. In light of this, TMC has intentionally shifted away from offering segregated programs or housing for international students and TCKs.

  ## Missionaries-in-Residence

  Each year The Master’s College hosts a hand-picked missionary family (on furlough) living on campus (this could be you!). Their home—kitchen, fireplace, and all—is available to students who want to stop by. TMC’s [Missionaries-in-Residence](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/global-outreach/missionary-in-residence.aspx "Missionaries in Residence") become a great asset not only to students currently pursuing global missions, but to international students and TCKs who just want to share their own experiences with someone, or seek a bit of extra advice.

  Amy grew up in Southern California and came to TMC to study Business Administration and Management. As a student at Master’s, she was privileged to co-lead Global Outreach teams to Montgomery, Alabama; Albania; and Kosovo. In the future, Amy would like to study for a Master’s in Business Administration, then use business as mission by working overseas or in the inner city.

  ## Fast Facts:

  ### A Favorite Scripture Verse: Revelation 1:5b-8

  “To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he is coming witht he clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. 'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.'"

  about-body: We are committed to developing a distinctively Christian multi-cultural
    community under the lordship of Christ and according to His Word. We recognize
    that cultures not only stem from continents and countries, but arise within cities
    and regions in our nation. Through our Multi-Cultural Student Advancement Office,
    we seek to serve and care for students who join us from diverse contexts. We desire
    to see students of different cultures participating in and contributing to campus
    life as well as the community through service and ministry opportunities. Clubs
    like the C3 Unity Club work to grow interpersonal relationships on campus and
    promote genuine Christian unity. Our culturally diverse chapel program and on-campus
    public forums provide opportunity for every student to grow in awareness and compassion
    toward multi-cultural issues.
  biblical-foundation-body: |-
    The motto of The Master’s University –*For Christ and Scripture*- signifies our commitment to the reality of the universal lordship of Jesus Christ and the sufficiency of His Word. We are bound to this reality because of our anchoring in the Scriptures, which present Christ as Lord over all creation.[\[1\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn1) This confession of Christ’s preeminence gives TMU commanding reasons to welcome, affirm and celebrate diversities of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and culture in its population and programs.

    In creating man God elected to create him in the very likeness and image of Himself.[\[2\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn2) The Bible clearly points that all humans are made in the image of God. The image of God (*imago dei*) designates mankind as the image bearers of God, carrying the same attributes with their Creator.[\[3\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn3) This stems to every person from every tribe, tongue, and ethnicity that exists, since God made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth.[\[4\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn4) Understanding this then it is to be resolved that every human being possesses an inherent dignity, meaning, and worth –he or she being made in the *imago dei.*

    It is true that the unity of the created order is deeply disrupted by sin. Men and women, families, tribes, ethnicities, and nations have been set against one another, with differences among people often serving as a pretext for personal and systematic injustice.[\[5\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn5) Yet God has responded to the sin of prejudice and partiality not by abandoning His world, but by providing for its redemption[\[6\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn6) and reconciliation.[\[7\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn7) In consequence, a core value of the Christian church is unity. Jesus prayed that his followers might have complete unity so that the world might believe and know that he was sent by the Father.[\[8\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn8) God’s people are called to repent of sin, grow in grace, acknowledge and submit to truth, seek justice, show mercy, practice forgiveness, and go and make disciples of *all nations* [\[9\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn9)–all because of Christ’s atoning work by which, we’ve been *united* together in Him, and the power of sin has been broken.

    Given the divine intention for creation, then, we see human diversity as a feature of life worth savoring; a featured designed and embraced by God. The unity of the kingdom, attained and emulated on earth by Christian fellowship,[\[10\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn10) gladly acknowledges the variety of personal backgrounds, histories, and contexts out of which love, thanksgiving, and worship are rendered to God. The vision of heaven presented by the Apostle John in the book of Revelation is that of a diverse group of believers from every tribe, language, people and nation, who find their unity, not in similar cultural customs or linguistic patterns, but rather in their worship of the one and only King of kings and Lord of lords, the Lamb upon the throne, Jesus. [\[11\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn11)

    Anticipating this fulfillment, Christian relationships across differences are to be unbiased and impartial rather than repressive, joyful and loving rather than dismissive. Individuals must not be stigmatized for being different; rather within the church, diversity is a glorious property of the whole. *“We”* are a diverse body of many members, from various languages, cultures and continents, which have been *united together* in Christ eternally is the sentiment shared by all true Christians. This is only achievable through the gospel which gives us new eyes to see from the vantage point(s) of creation/redemption, to our future hope and glory.[\[12\]](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/biblical-foundation/#_ftn12)

    Our Mission

    The office of Multicultural Student Advancement (MCSA) serves to help develop and maintain a distinctively Christian, diverse community at the Master’s College (TMU). We desire to see students, from different cultures and from various contexts, participating in and contributing to the overall educational experience of campus life at TMU.

    ## Our Vision

    MCSA strives to empower students to embrace a healthy biblical perspective of diversity, and achieve cultural competency, while motivating and teaching them to model love and unity that values the contributions of all people. This is achieved through the offering of programs and events that are affirming and supportive of the diverse ethnic and cultural realities of our world.

    ## Our Objectives

    ### To enroll students from ethnically and culturally diverse contexts:

    Recruiting students of color and students from other underrepresented groups\
    Assisting prospective “minority” students considering study at TMU\
    Providing academic advising and student advocacy\
    Helping with the procurement of scholarship and sponsorship grant monies

    ### To share cultural experience(s) and insight with the student body that will assist in:

    Creating a supportive campus culture, through culturally relevant programs and events\
    Strengthening cross-cultural relationships\
    Cultivating awareness and sensitivity related to issues of culture and ethnicity

    ## Our Method:

    As a hybrid office between the Student Life and Admissions departments, MCSA specializes in both the recruitment and retention of students from among the diverse cultural contexts within the United States. Focusing on urban centers and the inner city, we seek to establish relationships with churches and leaders in these communities that will assist us in identifying “mission-match” recruits for TMU, while developing culturally applicable programming and social support for the underrepresented student population of our school.

    C3Unity- Student led club

    Founded on the premise of Colossians 3:11- “Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all”, C3Unity works to grow interpersonal relationships on campus and promote genuine Christian unity among the students of TMU. The club gives students an opportunity to interact and network with others from diverse contexts as well as to learn how they can live as effective Christian witnesses in a multicultural environment on the campus of TMU and around the world. Throughout the year C3Unity organizes events, field trips, forums, and workshops alongside the Student Life Staff, Associate Academic Dean, and Faculty. Be a part of [C3Unity - Join the Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/220366394683071/ "C3Unity on Facebook")

    ## Engage!

    One of our desires at the Master’s University is that students would graduate with a deep commitment and affection for the local church. One of the ways that we stroke the fire of their hearts to that end is Engage! This fall outreach event is a ministry exposure designed to inspire and mobilize our students to serve with local churches. We cancel classes and break up into small teams to work with churches in: evangelism, children’s and youth outreach, college outreach, ethnic outreach, manual labor projects, sports outreach, music ministry, women’s ministry, ministry to the deaf and blind, and ministry to the elderly. [More about Engage! here...](http://www.masters.edu/student-life/student-advancement/multicultural-students/programs/engage/ "Fall Outreach Week")

    ## Chapel/Public Forums

    Chapel at The Master's College exists for the proclamation of God’s Word to our campus community. Our culturally diverse chapel program throughout the year provides an opportunity for every student to grow in awareness and compassion toward multicultural issues. There are also on-campus public forums which serve to help students express the joys, concerns, struggles and triumphs that they see and experience. The goal is conscious cultivation of the Christian virtues of humility, discernment, courage, justice and love on our campus. [See Thabiti Anyabwile preach on "Ethnicity & the Mission of God" at the 2012 Truth & Life Conerence.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G4IYjxmKZc&list=PL6B5491A55AED1001&index=5&feature=plpp_video "Video on YouTube")

    ## Introduction To Urban Ministry (Fall Semester)

    During the fall semester of each school year Dr. Mark Tatlock teaches ‘Introduction to Urban Ministry,’ a class offered as part of fulfillment of cross cultural units in the traditional undergrad program. Intro to Urban Ministry is designed to expose students to the dynamics of inner city ministry by personally investigating how principles of missions are implemented in urban churches and ministries within the greater Los Angeles. The office of Multicultural Student Advancement assists Dr. Tatlock with instruction and weekly field trips to Urban Ministry sites throughout Los Angeles County.

    ## The Multicultural Student Advancement office also serves TMU through:

    ### The recruiting and acquisition of students from ethnically and culturally diverse contexts

    ### The procurement of scholarship and sponsorship monies

    ### Academic advising and student advocacy

    ### The coordinating of campus wide educational workshops/seminars

    ### Referrals to urban and ethnic church and community outreach organizations

    ### The development of culturally applicable programming and social support of underrepresented students

    ### Student organization involvement
