  lasting contribution to the Kingdom of God.

  Week of Welcome (WOW) is intentionally designed to help make your transition to TMU a little easier. This program provides all incoming students with information about academics, student activities, student services, residence life, international programs, and much more. This week begins with check-in taking place on WOW Saturday at our WOW Welcome Tents. You proceed from there through the rest of the check-in process and finally be directed up to the dorms, for those living on campus.

  Throughout WOW, new students will have the opportunity to engage with administrators, faculty, staff, and student leaders (SLS). SLS will be available throughout the week to answer any questions you may have.
