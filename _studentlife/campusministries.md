  ### A Favorite Scripture Verse: Ephesians 2:4-7

  "But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."

  Week of Welcome (WOW) is intentionally designed to help make your transition to TMU a little easier. This program provides all incoming students with information about academics, student activities, student services, residence life, international programs, and much more. This week begins with check-in taking place on WOW Saturday at our WOW Welcome Tents. You proceed from there through the rest of the check-in process and finally be directed up to the dorms, for those living on campus.

  Throughout WOW, new students will have the opportunity to engage with administrators, faculty, staff, and student leaders (SLS). SLS will be available throughout the week to answer any questions you may have.
