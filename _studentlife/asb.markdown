  ## The Master’s University Society for Science and Mathematics

  *Established 2010*

  The purpose of the society is to encourage scientific scholarship, curiosity, inquiry, colleague fellowship, and educational activities in a God-honoring manner, in agreement with The Master’s University mission statement. We seek to encourage camaraderie between science majors and faculty specifically, as well as the entire campus, to encourage student-faculty communication for the further development and sharpening of the science and math majors, and to provide community services such as: high school and peer tutoring, home school outreach, and environmental stewardship. We seek to live as ambassadors of Christ and TMU to the scientific and educational community, and to engage in creation and bioethical research, discussion, and scholarship; we desire to pursue biblical truth in every arena of science.

  ## Cliff Hangers

This Society is solely dedicated to learn more about the business world; while keeping God at the center.

  ## The Silent Club

  Established 2015

  Our desire is to practice “American Sign Language” in conversational set-ups so that we can become fluent in the language as well as to provide an opportunity for other students to comfortably learn some of the language. We want to eventually be able to use this language to spread the gospel to the Deaf people in our community.

  ## Evangelism Society

  *Established 2012*
