  ## Student Care Leadership

  The Student Care Department believes that biblical community life on this campus is initiated and modeled by its students. The mission of TMU as defined in the doctrinal statements and modeled through the Distinctives is fleshed out in the context of a life-on-life community. It is through the lives of committed students who are faithful to pursue this goal and call others to follow that the reality of a biblical community can be lived out on campus.

  Being on Student Care Leadership at The Master’s University is an incredible privilege and at the same time a great responsibility. It is the aim of Student Care Leadership to be a team that honors the Lord in all they do, to sacrifice of themselves for the growth of the community, and to model Christ likeness consistently, with the goal of impacting lives on The Master’s University campus for the Kingdom.

  With these goals in mind, Student Care Leadership provides an opportunity for various students to serve in specific ministry capacities both on and off campus. These opportunities include service as a Global Outreach missions team leader, as an International Student Liaison, Military Student Liaison, a Multicultural Student Liaison, an Off Campus Assistant, as a Resident Assistant, or an Assistant Resident Assistant in one of the residence halls.
