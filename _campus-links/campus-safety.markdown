Directors-greeting-body: "Welcome to The Master's University!      \n\nThe campus
  safety department provides the day to day public safety services for the university.
  In addition to working full-time for the campus safety department, many of our employees
  are full time students taking classes here on campus or at the Seminary in Sun Valley,
  also led by our President, John MacArthur. All that to say, I want you to know that
  you are served by a group of officers who are not only concerned for your personal
  safety but genuinely have a servant's heart for you to grow in Christ.\n\nThe campus
  safety department maintains a 24 hour presence on the university property, and the
  main campus guard shack is located across the street from the MacArthur Center at
  the entrance to the residential housing area. You will frequently see our officers
  on foot or vehicle patrols in and around the campus or within the guard shack. There
  is also an administrative office located on the north academic campus that is open
  during general business hours, where you may gain assistance with any permitting
  or other business.\n\nThe Master's University is blessed to be located within a
  quiet, residential community, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department charts
  our geographical area within a low to negligible crime zone. It is not uncommon
  to see horses being ridden down the sides of the road from one of the many beautiful
  ranches, or neighbors buzzing past our campus on golf carts. There is even a historic
  movie studio located a ½ mile down Placerita Canyon Road called Melody Ranch where
  John Wayne films were made, and some Western movies are still filmed today. Please
  drive the side streets slowly and carefully. We work hard to maintain an excellent
  Christian testimony with the many homeowners that surround our campus property.\n\nIt
  is our joy to serve you and we hope to make your years at TMU as safe and secure
  as we possibly can. We have a motto in the campus safety department and hope that
  both you and your parents embrace it. It is based on Psalm 127:1, \"Unless the LORD
  guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain.\" We place our trust in the hands
  of our sovereign God, and look upon ourselves as one of many means He uses on this
  campus to bless and grow you, for His glory and your good.\n\nPlease click on the
  many links from our home page for important safety information related to our parking
  and general regulations, and more!\n\nAgain, on behalf of the entire public safety
  team I want to personally welcome you as a student of The Master's University!\n\n**C.

preparedness-body: "The Campus Safety Department works in close partnership with the
  Los Angeles County Fire and Sheriff's Department, who have stations within close
  proximity to the University. The Campus Safety Department plays one part in a larger
  Emergency Management Plan which the college incorporates to facilitate effective
  coordination of resources in any emergency. In the event of a life threatening emergency,
  cellular text messages to registered users will be distributed to communicate important
  instructions on how Faculty, Staff, and Students should respond.\n\n## Dare to Prepare\n\n*

Crime-Fire Log-body: "## Daily Crime and Fire Log\n\nThe Daily Crime Log includes
  a record of all crimes reported to campus safety that occurred anywhere within the
  department’s patrol jurisdiction and all fires reportedly occurring in the residence
  halls over the past 60 days. The log is designed to provide timelier details and
  greater information to the campus community than the annual statistical disclosures.
  \n\nThe most recent 60 days of the log is available on the campus safety web page
  but the log is also available for public inspection upon request during regular
  business hours at the campus safety business office.  Older portions of the log
  are available within two business days of request at the same location. Note: If
  a log entry disposition changes after 60 days have passed the log may not reflect
  those changes. In addition, under specific circumstances, the campus safety department
  may temporarily withhold information in the log. \n\nIn general, entries in this
  log will be given one of the following dispositions to reflect the current status
  of the incident: \n\n**Term\t                            Definition**\n\nActive

  Golf Cart Safety Training Program

  Welcome to The Master's University Golf Cart Safety Training Program! This program has been developed to encourage safe operation on TMU campus properties of golf carts or any type of electric or low powered industrial style utility carts. All faculty, staff, and students who may operate a cart on the TMU properties are required to complete this training.

  ## 3 Steps to Safety

  Step 1: Click [here](https://www2.masters.edu/edit/GolfCartVideo.asp) to view the Golf Cart Training Presentation.

  Step 2: Read the [Cart Safety Fact Sheet](http://www2.masters.edu/w/GetHostedFile.ashx?TMC\+Cart\+Safety\+Fact\+Sheet.pdf&Id=588) and download, sign, and send the [Acknowledgement of Responsibility Form](http://www2.masters.edu/w/GetHostedFile.ashx?Acknowledgement\+of\+Responsibility\+for\+Carts.pdf&Id=587) to Campus Safety, box 34.

  Step 3: Test drive with a supervisor prior to regular operation of the cart.

  * It is important to be accompanied by a supervisor around campus as each department may maintain additional rules regarding cart operation and charging. This is not an optional step as your signed acknowledgement of responsibility form indicates. If your department has no experienced drivers please email campussecurity@masters.edu for further assistance.

  \*Note to Supervisors: Please instruct each person in the basic knowledge of the cart's functions and evaluate their skills as they operate on different parts of the campus properties. Speed is always a factor as well as operating around blind corners.

  Anyone involved in a cart collision which results in property damage or injury must report the incident to a supervisor and campus safety.

  For more information on TMU policies and procedures with respect to driving vehicles on campus please review the vehicle code on our main website or contact the Director of Campus Safety.
