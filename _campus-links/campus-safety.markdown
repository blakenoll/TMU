Directors-greeting-body: "Welcome to The Master's University!      \n\nThe Campus
  Safety Department provides the University's in house private security and public
  safety services. In addition to working full-time for the University Safety Department,
  many of the Safety employees are studying at The Master's Seminary, also led by
  our President, John MacArthur. All that to say, I want you to know that you are
  served by a group of officers who are not only concerned for your safety, but genuinely
  have a Pastor's heart for you to grow in Christ.\n\nThe Safety Department maintains
  a 24 hour presence on The Master's University property, and the Main Security Booth
  is located across the street from the Gym, at the entrance to the residential housing
  area. You will frequently see officers walking around the campus, locking and unlocking
  buildings, and working within the security booth. There is also a business office
  located on North Campus and open during posted business hours, where you may gain
  assistance with any administrative business with our Department.\n\nThe Master's
  University is blessed to be located within a quiet, residential community, and the
  Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department charts our geographical area within a low
  to negligible crime zone. It is not uncommon to see horses being ridden down the
  sides of the road from one of the many beautiful ranches, or neighbors buzzing past
  our campus on golf carts. There is even a historic movie studio located a Â½ mile
  down Placerita Canyon Road where John Wayne films were made, and some Western movies
  are still filmed today. Please drive the side streets slowly and carefully. We work
  hard to maintain an excellent Christian testimony with the many homeowners that
  surround our campus property.\n\nIt is our joy to serve you, and we hope to make
  your years at TMU, as safe and secure as we possibly can. We have a motto in the
  Safety Department and hope that both you and your parents embrace it. It is based
  on Psalm 127:1, \"Unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman keeps awake in vain.\"
  We place our trust in the hands of our sovereign God, and look upon ourselves as
  one of many means He uses on this campus to bless and grow you, for His glory and
  your good.\n\nPlease click on the many links from our home page for important safety
  information related to our parking and general regulations, and more!\n\nAgain,
  on behalf of the entire Safety staff, I want to personally welcome you as a student
  of The Master's University!\n\n**C. Powell**\nDirector of Campus Safety\nThe Master's

  Los Angeles County Fire and Sheriff's Department, who have stations within close
  proximity to the University. The Campus Safety Department plays one part in a larger
  Emergency Management Plan which the college incorporates to facilitate effective
  coordination of resources in any emergency. In the event of a life threatening emergency,
  cellular text messages to registered users will be distributed to communicate important
  instructions on how Faculty, Staff, and Students should respond.\n\n## Dare to Prepare\n\n*

  [Campus Safety Codes](/campussafetycodes)

  It is important that each member of the campus community prioritize the safety of others on the campus. The Campus Safety Codes (aka the "Vehicle Code") and updates contain the parking rules, vehicle codes, and general safety regulations for faculty, staff, students and guests at TMU. In order to assist you with complying with our regulations, we offer you the following highlights (please ensure you review the actual codes in each of these areas to ensure full compliance):

  ## How do I obtain a parking permit?

  Students: Please register the car you intend to bring to campus for the semester during pre-registration, but you may also register a car anytime by using Self-Service / Vehicle Registration (semester fee applies). Please ensure you print the registration confirmation and bring it to the guard shack in order to obtain a semester permit to affix to your vehicle (inside, lower left corner of windshield). Even if you only intend to bring a car to park on campus for one day, campus safety requires all students to obtain a temporary parking permit. You may obtain the temporary permit free of charge by stopping by the guard shack but a fourth temporary permit in one semester will result in billing for a semester registration fee. Please display the temporary permit on your driver's side dashboard.

  Faculty and Staff: You may register by filling out the form on Content Management / Staff Links / TMU Forms / Vehicle Registration Form. You may bring it by Human Resources for a semester permit. If you are borrowing a car for less than a week, faculty and staff are not required to obtain temporary passes.

  Guests: Park in any undesignated space free of charge! No permit is required.

  ## How do I appeal a ticket?

  Students : To appeal a campus safety ticket please use Content Management / My Parking Tickets within seven days of the posting of your ticket online. Unless voided, tickets will be forwarded to student accounts for billing after 30 days.

  Faculty and Staff: To appeal a campus safety ticket please email the Director of Campus Safety.

  Guests: Please return your ticket to the guard shack so we may void it and courteously inform you of our parking expectations.

  ## Where can I park?

  Resident Students: By far the most common violation on campus is issued to resident students for parking on lower campus, Monday thru Friday between 8AM-5PM. Outside these hours you are free to park on lower campus, like a commuter. While exceptions are granted to resident students with injuries or medical conditions (inquire at the guard shack), exceptions are rarely made for class/work conflicts or spending the night off campus for an evening. It is the responsibility of each student to arrange their personal schedules to comply with the parking situation. If you think your situation is out of the ordinary, you may schedule an appointment with the Director of Campus Safety. As an additional reminder: Do not leave a vehicle in a fire lane unattended by the dorms for any length of time.

  Commuter Students: Park in any available undesignated parking space. Faculty, Staff, and guests have designated and painted parking spaces but we also invite guests to use any unmarked student space (like a commuter) when visiting us.

  ## What if a campus parking lot is full?

  One of the more common violations for students is assuming it is okay to park on the side street (or wherever you choose) anytime a campus parking lot is full. To ensure compliance with fire and other state codes please only park in the striped spaces provided in each lot. Also, as a courtesy to our neighbors, faculty, staff, and students should not park on the side streets. Please allow for adequate time to use an alternate parking lot for chapel or for class in smaller commuter lots like Reese lot. During conference and other large events we require faculty, staff, and students to observe the same rules, but campus safety is not responsible for guests parking contrary to local ordinances outside our lots.

  ## Pedestrians

  Please use the designated sidewalks and cross walks to walk between sections of the campus. Please do not assume vehicles will stop but pay attention and look both ways. It is helpful if you allow cars to cross during peak crosswalk hours rather than trickling through one at a time while the car waits for 5 minutes. Remember: Do unto others! If you must walk along the road (particularly when the athletic fences are closed between the Library and North Campus for a ball game), please walk off the road and do not make vehicles drive around you in the street. This is a common frustration for the commuters and our canyon neighbors!

  ## Skateboards

  Skateboards, scooters, and roller blades may be ridden on campus sidewalks with due regard for pedestrian right of way, but there is no riding allowed on or across driveways, in parking lots, or on the adjacent roads in our community. Rule of Thumb: Skateboards cannot be ridden where cars can go. Skateboards may only be used at TMU for transportation and all 4 wheels need to stay grounded at all time. If you would like to perform those cool tricks, please do so at the local skate park using the right safety equipment (Santa Clarita Aquatic Center). The full content of this and all policies is found within the Campus Safety Codes.

  Golf Cart Safety Training Program

  Welcome to The Master's University Golf Cart Safety Training Program! This program has been developed to encourage safe operation on TMU campus properties of golf carts or any type of electric or low powered industrial style utility carts. All faculty, staff, and students who may operate a cart on the TMU properties are required to complete this training.

  ## 3 Steps to Safety

  Step 1: Click [here](https://www2.masters.edu/edit/GolfCartVideo.asp) to view the Golf Cart Training Presentation.

  Step 2: Read the [Cart Safety Fact Sheet](http://www2.masters.edu/w/GetHostedFile.ashx?TMC\+Cart\+Safety\+Fact\+Sheet.pdf&Id=588) and download, sign, and send the [Acknowledgement of Responsibility Form](http://www2.masters.edu/w/GetHostedFile.ashx?Acknowledgement\+of\+Responsibility\+for\+Carts.pdf&Id=587) to Campus Safety, box 34.

  Step 3: Test drive with a supervisor prior to regular operation of the cart.

  * It is important to be accompanied by a supervisor around campus as each department may maintain additional rules regarding cart operation and charging. This is not an optional step as your signed acknowledgement of responsibility form indicates. If your department has no experienced drivers please email campussecurity@masters.edu for further assistance.

  \*Note to Supervisors: Please instruct each person in the basic knowledge of the cart's functions and evaluate their skills as they operate on different parts of the campus properties. Speed is always a factor as well as operating around blind corners.

  Anyone involved in a cart collision which results in property damage or injury must report the incident to a supervisor and campus safety.

  For more information on TMU policies and procedures with respect to driving vehicles on campus please review the vehicle code on our main website or contact the Director of Campus Safety.
