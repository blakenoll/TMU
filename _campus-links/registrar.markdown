  ## Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as Amended

    The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA; also known as the "Buckley Amendment") and provisions of the California Education Code set out requirements designed to govern the access to, and release of, educational records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. Students also have the right to file complaints with the FERPA Office at the [United States Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/index.jsp) concerning alleged failures by The Master's University to comply with provisions of FERPA.

    In accordance with the regulations of FERPA, as amended, The Master's University has adopted policies and procedures concerning the implementation of FERPA on campus. Copies of the policy are available in the Office of the registrar. The Department of Education offers a copy of the [FERPA regulations online](http://www.ed.gov/offices/OM/fpco/ferpa/index.html).

    ## Directory Information

    Certain information designated as "Directory Information" may be disclosed without the consent or knowledge of the student unless the student has notified The Master's University in advance that such information is not to be released. "Directory Information" at The Master's University is defined as:

    * Name

    * Address

    * Telephone listing

    * E-mail Address

    * Date of birth (verification only)

    * Major field of study

    * Participation in officially recognized activities and sports

    * Height and weight of members of athletic teams

    * Dates of attendance at the university

    * Degrees and honors received

    * Enrollment status (undergraduate or graduate, full-time or part-time)

    * Year in school

    * Photographs

    * The most recent educational agency or institution attended

    The purpose of establishing this definition of Directory Information is to notify the student of the types of personally identifiable information included with this definition of "Directory Information" and to allow the student to prevent the disclosure of this information should he or she wish to do so.

    The student may request that his or her information remain confidential by checking the "No" option under the "Contact Information" section of the Student Registration Form.

    ## Implications of Specifying Confidentiality to Student Records

    Students requesting that their records remain confidential should be aware that no information will be given out to anyone, including immediate family members and potential employers, regarding any information about the student. Students with confidentiality are not able to obtain information concerning their own records unless they inquire in person or by writing a request which includes their signature.

    Students who have requested that their information remain confidential and who withdraw or graduate from the university should be aware that their information will remain confidential and will not be released without the signature and expressed consent of that student.

    ## Exceptions

    The university does not permit access to, or the release of, personally identifiable information or educational records, to any individual without the written consent of the student, with the following exceptions:

    * To administrators, faculty, or staff of the university, having legitimate educational concerns.

    * To medical personnel when the health of the student or others would be endangered by the withholding of information.

    * To financial aid personnel in connection with an application for such aid.

    * To the parents of dependent children.

    * To the governmental officials designated by law, or in compliance with a judicial order.

  ## I. Philosophy

    Learning to grow in the knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the mission of Christian higher education. We want to educate the heart as well as the mind, desiring to maintain an atmosphere that will be conducive to the development of spiritual maturity and discernment. Because each student coming to The Master’s University professes faith in Jesus Christ, we expect students to grow in that faith through the work of the Holy Spirit.

    The Master's University is committed to developing its students into people who obey biblical mandates because they are personally accountable to God and His Word rather than to man alone. University policies are designed by the administration to facilitate an educational environment which honors the Lord.

    The student, by virtue of their signature on the application for admission, agrees to live within the framework of the standards of the university both on and off campus while each semester is in session. Though one’s personal convictions may differ with these standards, a student’s choice to become a part of The Master's University community implies a commitment to abide by the established policies.

    God calls all believers to submit to the governing authorities (this includes federal, state, and/or local governments and their respective legislation). Romans 13 directs, "Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God…render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor" (vv. 1, 7). Current laws governing the use of technology require students to honor these laws as a mandate regardless of personal opinion. Students who are in violation of such laws will face the consequences of campus discipline, as well as, legal liability.

    ## II. Definitions

    Electronic Media – Any electronic medium, including but not limited to: email text, chat, email attachments, gaming, web page viewing, video files, audio files, or computer/program files.

    TMU Network – Any TMU computer, server, software, program, facility or the hardware/equipment involved in the interconnection and interoperation of these items, or any said device connected to any such device at TMU (for example, any laptop/PC connected to the TMU wired/wireless network).

    Hacking – Defined as attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data – this includes any unauthorized attempt to incapacitate, interrupt, view, alter, copy or delete systems, networks or data.

    “Video” – Defined as watching audio/visual content (or files of such) via PC, DVD player, Blu-ray player, Television, or any other equipment.

    “Foreign” Media – Defined as data, images, programs, games, viruses, etc. which did not originally reside on the TMU network.

    Texting – Refers to the exchange of brief written messages between fixed-line phone or mobile phone and fixed or portable devices over a network.

    ## III. Guidelines

    Any “unwholesome” [i.e. actions inconsistent with our profession as Christ’s followers committed to holiness, truth, and the proper stewardship of His blessings (possessions, time, etc.)] use of Electronic Media which may include, but not be limited to: email text, chat, email attachments, video files, audio files, electronic/internet gaming, web page viewing or file transfers is expressly forbidden.

    ### Email – Electronic mail which meets the following criteria is prohibited:

    Spamming – An attempt by any student(s) to issue unsolicited bulk email to other students, or to anyone outside of The Master's University.

    Spoofing – Any attempt to send an email which appears to have originated from someone other than the actual sender. Unrelated to email, prohibited “spoofing” also includes any attempt to impersonate/borrow another user’s login.

    ### Internet/TMU Network – Internet/TMU Network/MasterNet use is restricted in the following ways:

    Web Page viewing – Viewing http, https, ftp, or any Internet site regardless of protocol with illegal, pornographic, or any other immoral material is prohibited.

    Chat – Any application used for “Internet Messaging” or “Instant Messaging” cannot be used for illegal file trading (including, but not limited to audio/video files) or to send illicit messages to anyone.

    Uploading & Downloading of any type of electronic media file – The use of the Internet or the TMU Network for uploading and/or downloading files which contain unwholesome or illegal content is prohibited. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: ANY CONTENT WHICH IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT LAW. Therefore, any file sharing involving music, video, audio, computer programs, etc. in which the distributor of the media (web page/site or server) is not a legal and officially licensed distributor of the media is PROHIBITED. Stated alternately, all “pirated” material is clearly prohibited. Simply because media is accessible, or free of charge, does not make it legal. Whether an individual “thinks” such a file transfer/download is legal is irrelevant; Copyright Law indicates it is stealing.

    The illegal distribution of copyrighted materials, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject students to criminal and civil penalties. A summary of the penalties for violation of Federal copyright laws can be found at http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html. Any student found to be in violation of these policies could be subject to institutional discipline in addition to criminal and civil penalties.

    Hacking – Any usage of the TMU Network for activities that are directly or indirectly, advertently or inadvertently considered “hacking” are prohibited. Any attempt to bypass security or content restrictions (such as web page filtering) is considered “hacking.”

    Foreign Media – Any attempt to introduce “foreign”, harmful, and/or inappropriate media to The Master’s University Network is clearly prohibited (this includes, but is not limited to: viruses, worms, etc.). Complete responsibility for such actions lies with the student(s) who introduce it. Intentional introduction will be treated as hacking and the destruction of property.

    Usage for Internet/Server-The TMU network is not to be used to set up a personal “server.” The server prohibition includes, but is not limited to: file sharing, DCHP, WINS, DNS, Directory Services and Web Services. For an extended definition, see the Network Use Policy ([NetworkPolicy](http://www.masters.edu/networkpolicy "NetworkPolicy")).

    ### Phone Usage - Illicit or harassing phone calls are prohibited. This includes calls to phone services with sexual content, or any type of inappropriate calls with/to other students.

    Texting – Illicit or harassing texting is prohibited. This includes texts with sexual content, or any type of inappropriate texts with/to other students.

    Printing/Scanning – Printing or scanning or illegal, pornographic, or any other immoral material is prohibited.

    ## IV. Consequences

    Each student bears full responsibility for his/her actions as they relate to the use of the TMU Network or any electronic media. Discipline for all infractions of the Media Ethics Policy will be under the direction of Student Life. This may include, but is not limited to, the suspension and/or revocation of network and Internet access and services.

    1. All legal consequences involving the use/misuse of the TMU Network or equipment lie solely with the user.

  ## Add/Drop/Withdrawal

    The add/drop period (the first two weeks of each semester) allows students to make changes to their class schedules. We strongly recommend that students work with their academic advisor to ensure that they are on track to meet their degree requirements.

    Classes may be added during the first two weeks of each semester. Between the 3rd and 13th weeks of each semester, students may withdraw from classes without a grade penalty by completing an add/drop form and submitting it to the Registrar's Office to make the changes. The student will receive a W (withdrawal) grade in that course. A student who never attends (or stops attending) a course for which he is officially registered without following the accepted procedures will be awarded the grade earned in that course.

    ## Directed Studies

    A Directed Studies (DS) course is a course that does not meet as a regularly scheduled class. A DS course may be appropriate to resolve a scheduling conflict, to complete a course not offered in a given academic term, or to study an academic topic or subject matter not offered by TMU.

    Note: Effective Fall 2016, new procedures and deadlines apply to DS courses. New DS courses must comply with all TMU procedures and deadlines that apply to non-DS courses, unless specifically stated otherwise.

    A "Directed Studies Course Contract" is used to enroll in a DS course. A completed Contract may be submitted to the Registrar's Office as soon as the registration period opens for a given academic term and must be submitted no later than the end of the add/drop period for the academic term in which the DS course is to be added. For Spring 2017, a DS course may not be added after Monday, January 30, 2017. Drop/withdrawal procedures are identical to those for non-DS courses.

    A DS course taken in either the Fall or Spring term must be completed by the end of that academic term. A DS course taken in either the Winter or Summer term must be completed by the Friday before the start of the subsequent academic term. If a student does not compete the DS work on time, the Registrar's Office will assign a grade of "F" to the student for the DS course.

    For tuition purposes, there is no distinction between units from DS and non-DS courses. Tuition refunds for dropping a DS course will be calculated and processed in accordance with normal Student Accounts procedures. A DS course fee of $50 per unit may be assessed in addition to tuition. The DS course fee is non-refundable after the end of the add/drop period.

    A student may enroll in no more than two DS courses in any one academic term, and a maximum of 13 units of TMU DS coursework may be used to complete a bachelor's degree program.

    ## Repeated Courses

    A student may repeat any course which was previously attempted. No additional credits may be earned, however, by repeating a course which a student has already passed (grade of D- or higher) unless the course is designated as repeatable for credit. When a course is repeated at The Master's University, the subsequent grade replaces the previous grade for GPA purposes (even if lower), but the previous grade remains on the student's academic record and transcript.

    ## Grade Changes

    It is the student's responsibility to immediately bring any error in grades to the attention of the instructor. Grade changes are made at the discretion of the instructor and will be posted to the student's permanent record when the instructor completes a Grade Change Form and returns it to the Registrar's Office.

    ## Non-Term Courses

    Non-term courses are identified as those not taken during the fall or spring semesters. Non-term at The Master's University is considered as winterim and post-session.

    Winterim takes place during the second week of January. Course registration for winterim takes place simultaneously with spring course registration and extends until the first day of the winterim class. Tuition and fees are included on the student's spring bill. A student may take no more than three total units during winterim.

    Post-session takes place during two time periods: 1) the final three weeks of May and 2) the first three weeks of June. Course registration for post-session begins during spring course registration and extends until the first day of the post-session class. Tuition and fees must be paid before the first day of class. A student may take no more than six units during each post-session.

    ## Awarding of Credit by Examination

    The Master's University, as a member of the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB), recognizes the merits of the Advanced Placement (AP), the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and the International Baccalaureate (IB), and will grant credit for passing scores in certain tests offered through these programs. A student may earn a maximum of 32 semester units of AP/CLEP/IB exam transfer credit. If a student takes a college course for which he has already received AP/CLEP/IB credit, then he forfeits that transfer credit.

    The amount and type of credit awarded for each examination and the minimum passing score has been determined by the various academic departments. A list of acceptable AP/CLEP courses and credit granted for courses is available in the Registrar's Office. If AP/CLEP examinations have been taken, contact the Registrar's Office for information regarding acceptance of CLEP scores.

    Note: The Master's University has been designated as a national testing facility for the CLEP examination. For testing information, click here or contact the Center for Career Services at ext. 3002.

    ## Verification of Enrollment

    Written verification of enrollment may be requested by a student at any time during the semester. Verification of enrollment may be released to any party: for student loan deferment, good student discounts on auto insurance, health insurance, scholarships, etc. A copy of the verification is kept in the student's file. The Master's University can verify enrollment for current and previous semesters, not for future semesters.

    ## Change of Name/Contact Information

    Should you need to update your information for our student records, please forward the pertinent information (preferably in writing) to our office via email or post office.

    ## Scholastic Probation

    Any student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00 will be placed on academic probation for one semester. Any student entering on probation is limited to 15 units per semester. They must earn a minimum GPA of 2.00 at the end of the first semester to be removed from probation.

    Any student whose cumulative GPA remains below 2.00 for two consecutive semesters will be subject to academic disqualification. A student subject to disqualification may appeal by submitting a letter to the Vice President for Academic Affairs stating why he/she should not be disqualified. The student's request will then be reviewed by the Academic Affairs Council for final decision.

    The procedure for readmission of an academically disqualified student includes: (1) a minimum of one semester of academic suspension, (2) attendance at another accredited institution and achievement of a 2.50 cumulative GPA on a minimum of twelve semester units of transferable coursework with no course grade lower than a "C", and (3) review of the student's application for readmission by the admissions committee.

    Any student whose GPA falls below 2.00 may not participate in extracurricular activities such as student government, athletics, music and mission teams.

    ## Complete Withdrawal from The Master's University

    A student who, for any reason, finds it necessary to withdraw from the university during the course of the semester must do so through the Registrar's Office. The student must complete the Complete Withdrawal form. Failure to comply with these regulations will result in failing grades entered on the student's record. Any refund due the student is according to the refund policy available in the Student Accounts Center.
register-body: |-
  ## Registration

    Registration for the fall semester is held during the months of March and April, and for the spring semester in October and November. All students are required to register if they plan to return to school the following semester.

    Students register on-line with their advisors during their scheduled registration days. Registration is completed when students have completed Pre-Registration and have registered for classes using their Self-Service account.

    ## Check-In

    The purpose of Check-In is to verify the enrollment of students and enable them to complete the processes in a one-stop format. New Student Check-In for the fall is held on the Saturday of Week of Welcome while in the spring it is held in conjunction with Continuing Student Check-In. Continuing Student Check-In in the fall is held the day prior to the first day of classes and on the Tuesday before the first day of classes in the spring. Late Check-In begins the first day of classes following the final scheduled day of regular check-in and continues for five days.
senior-body: |-
  ## Senior/Graduate Contract

    Students intending to graduate must make a Graduation Contract appointment with the Registrar to start a "Senior Contract and Application for Graduation". The contract declares intent to graduate on a certain date, and allows the Registrar's Office to collect the necessary graduation information from the student. It also provides a method to specify exactly what coursework will be required of the student during his/her final year/semester. Once completed and signed, this form is a contract between the student, his/her advisor and the Registrar's Office. This form should be completed during the student's next-to-last semester before graduation.

    ## Undergraduate Graduation Requirements

    The Master's University grants bachelor's degrees to students who satisfy the graduation requirements described below:
    1. Complete a minimum of 122 semester units of credit.
    2. Complete a minimum of 40 semester units in upper division courses.
    3. Satisfy all General Education requirements.
    4. Complete the required curriculum for the chosen major field(s) of study.
    5. Maintain a minimum GPA of 2.00 (cumulative) in all TMU courses and in one's major(s).
    6. Complete a minimum of 32 semester units of non-Directed Studies coursework at TMU or 32 semester units of TMU Degree Completion Program major courses.
    7. Complete at least 12 of the final 24 semester units at TMU.

    Please note that degree requirements within each major are determined by the departmental faculty. Many majors feature a variety of emphases which may have different unit requirements for graduation. Progress toward fulfillment of these major requirements is monitored by departmental faculty and by the Registrar through senior contracts.

    Students are held to the unit requirements within general education and their major/emphasis according to the Academic Catalog under which they initially enter The Master's University. This applies, as well, to those students whose continuous enrollment is interrupted and then return to the university.

    Graduation ceremonies are held once a year with the conclusion of the spring semester, usually in May. Students who finish their degree in the fall semester will receive their degree immediately and are invited to walk in commencement exercises the following May.

    It is expected that all graduating students will be present at commencement ceremonies except in cases of extreme emergency or other similarly difficult circumstances. Permission to graduate in absentia must be secured from the Office of the Registrar well in advance.

    ## Undergraduate Graduation Honors

    Honors at graduation for baccalaureate recipients are granted to students who have completed at least 60 semester units at The Master's University and have attained the following cumulative grade point average:

    Cum Laude....................3.50-3.64
    Magna Cum Laude.........3.65-3.84
    Summa Cum Laude........3.85-4.00

    Honors recognized in the graduation ceremony may be changed based on the processing of final grades.

  transfer-policy-body: "## Transfer Studentsnn### Transfer Credit PoliciesnnTMU
    grants credit for college level coursework from other colleges and universities
    based on the following criteria:nn1. The student must have good standing at the
    institution(s) previously attended. Students who have been dismissed or suspended
    from another college for disciplinary reasons must request that a letter be sent
    by the dean of the college involved, detailing the reasons for such dismissal.nn2.
    No courses will be transferred in which the grade earned was less than C (2.0).
    Credit will be given for accepted courses which will apply toward the student's
    course of study at The Master's University.nn3. No more than 70 units of credit
    will be accepted from a junior/community college. Courses for which credit is allowed
    toward the bachelor's degree must be university transfer level.nn4. No more than
    94 units from other accredited institutions may apply toward fulfillment of degree
    requirements at The Master's University. Transfer students must take at least 12
    semester units of upper division work in their major at TMU.nn5. Students who
    are transferring from an accredited institution and who have completed a lower division
    course which had content comparable to an upper division course at The Master's
    University may: (a) choose to retake the course at TMU to earn upper division credit
    for the course; or (b) choose to pass a competency exam to verify that the lower
    division course was comparable in rigor to the upper division course at TMU. Passing
    the competency exam entitles the student to enroll in another upper division course
    to earn sufficient upper division credits.nn6. Transfer credit may be granted
    to students from unaccredited schools of collegiate rank upon approval of the Vice-President
    for Academic Affairs.nn7. The Master's University will grant credit for transferable
    college coursework taken before high school graduation if taken from an accredited
    college. Official transcripts must be submitted and all other transfer requirements
    met.nn8. The maximum number of transfer credits which will be awarded for various
    types of "non-traditional" college coursework from accredited institutions are
    as follows:nn   * 32 units of Advanced Placement (maximum of 32 units), CLEP examinations
    (maximum of 18 units), or credit by TMU assessment (maximum of 12 units).nn   *
    45 units of transfer credit from military transcript with maximum of 30 units applicable
    toward meeting TMU general education requirements.nn   * 36 units of non-traditional
    course work including: directed studies courses, correspondence courses, computer
    and WWW-based distance education courses, or video/ITV-based courses.nn## Credit
    Limits for Non-Traditional TMU CourseworknnThe maximum number of semester units
    from non-traditional format TMU courses that a student may count toward a degree
    program is as follows:nn* 13 units of TMU Directed Studies courses.nn* 24 units
    of intensive format TMU courses (Post-session, Winterim, or GE school).nn* 24
    units of credit for life experience assessment.nn## Credit by ExaminationnnThe
    Master's University, as a member of the College Entrance Examination Board, recognizes
    the merits of the Advanced Placement (AP), College Level Examination Program (CLEP),
    and the International Baccalaureate (IB), and will grant credit for passing scores
    in certain tests offered through these programs. A student may earn a maximum of
    32 semester units of AP/CLEP exam transfer credit. If a student takes a college
    course for which he/she has already received AP/CLEP credit, then he/she forfeits
    that transfer credit.nnThe Master's University reserves the right to determine
    the amount of credit that will be awarded for all AP/CLEP transfer credit examinations.
    Credit for all AP courses other than Math and Science, is awarded based on a score
    of "3", "4", or "5". Credit for Math and Science AP courses is awarded based
    on a score of "4" or "5". CLEP examination credit may be granted for all courses
    based on a CLEP score of 55 or above. The university will grant credit for IB examinations
    with scores of "5", "6", or "7".nnNote: The Master's University has been
    designated as a national testing facility for the CLEP examination. If CLEP examinations
    have already been taken, contact the Registrar's Office for information regarding
    acceptance of CLEP scores. For testing information, see our CLEP Testing pages.nn##
    The Master's Universitynn### AP Information & PoliciesnnHigh school students
    may receive advanced collegiate standing by participating in the Advanced Placement
    (AP) program. Up to 32 credits may be earned through this program or by other test-out
    procedures. Hours earned through Advanced Placement do not count as hours in residence
    toward graduation with honors.nnTo earn credit through Advanced Placement, students
    must enroll in specific AP courses offered by their respective high schools. Upon
    completing these courses, students take individual Advanced Placement examinations
    in each Advanced Placement course. Students may earn college credit for AP scores
    of three, four, or five. Students should request that scores from these examinations
    be sent directly to The Master's University by entering code number 4411 on their
    registration forms. Upon receiving these scores, the university awards the appropriate
    amount and type of credit for each examination as determined by each academic department.
    No fees other than the fees accompanying the examinations, must be paid in order
    to receive the college credit. In some cases, sophomore standing in particular subject
    areas may be earned through these examinations. Students should contact their local
    high schools to obtain Advanced Placement course and registration information.nn##
    The Master's Universitynn### CLEP Information & PoliciesnnThe Master's University
    participates in the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) sponsored by The College
    Board and administered nationally by Educational Testing Services through participating
    colleges and universities. This program is designed to provide the opportunity for
    students to earn college credit by passing examinations in subject areas in which
    they have already developed college-level knowledge and understanding. The examinations
    are composed of various multiple-choice questions and are administered in timed
    segments totaling 90 minutes.nnThe Master's University offers CLEP tests to current
    TMU students, as well as to individuals who have been accepted for admission to
    the university. For information on CLEP testing, [click here](http://www.masters.edu/campuslinks/testing/cleptesting/
    "ClepTesting").nnCLEP examinations and the scores required to qualify for credit
    at The Master's University are reviewed annually are effective from July 1 through
    the following June. Score reports are evaluated by the standards being utilized
    at the time the exam was taken.nnStudents may not pursue credit by CLEP examination
    for any course in which they have been enrolled. Additionally, students may not
    CLEP a course if they have taken a more advanced level course in that discipline.
    Hours earned through CLEP examinations do not count as hours in residence toward
    graduation with honors.nnNote: For students entering TMU as freshmen or sophomores,
    CLEP credit will only be awarded up to the end of the student's first semester of
    his/her senior year. For transfer juniors or seniors, CLEP credit will be awarded
    up to the fourth week of the final semester of the senior year.nnA maximum of
    32 semester units of test-out credit (including CLEP, AP, IB, and other department-approved
    test outs) may be earned toward a degree at The Master's University.nnThe CLEP
    program requires a minimum 6-month waiting period before repeating any test. CLEP
    exam results for high school students will be applied to the student's TMU transcript
    upon matriculation at the university.nnStudents may take CLEP exams at other institutions
    and request the scores be sent to The Master's University. This is done by designating
    The Master's University in the appropriate place when taking the exam. The Master's
    CLEP number is 4411. A complete list of test centers throughout the country is available
    from The College Board in Princeton, New Jersey, or can be referenced in the Career
    Services Center at The Master's University.nnFor more information contact:nnTMU
