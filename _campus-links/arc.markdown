Congratulations to all of our newly admitted students, and welcome to The Master’s University family!

We hope that you are excited about this new chapter in your life, and that you will take some time to explore how the Academic Resource Center (or ARC) can enhance your experience by providing helpful resources, services and learning opportunities and by encouraging a supportive campus community. ARC serves all TMU students, with a particular focus on peer-to-peer tutoring in various areas. At this time, we have tutoring labs available for students who need help with their academic papers/written projects, and math and accounting courses.

Below is the current hours and locations for all the tutoring labs and, if you click on the “meet the tutors” tab, you can see a picture of our current staff for the 2017-2018 school year.

For any other questions about labs, you can email us at [arc@masters.edu](mailto:arc@masters.edu)

For more specific needs, contact TMU’s academic counselor: Kara Antariksa. To schedule an appointment with the academic counselor, click [here](http://www.masters.edu/academiccounseling).
