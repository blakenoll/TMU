- title: Notebook Guide
  body: |-
    At the Master’s University we strive to provide our students with the greatest possible opportunities for education. To that end, we do require that every student bring a laptop computer to use for their classes. It is imperative that each student learn basic computing and office productivity skills so they can be better equipped in their respective fields. Classes also require papers, website access, and other technology related tasks that must be completed on a student’s laptop computer.

    Notebook Minimum Specifications

    • Windows 7 or above or Mac OS X 10.8 or above

    • Intel i5 Processor or better

    • 4 GB of RAM

    • 250 GB Hard Drive

    • 802.11ac

    • Anti-Virus Protection (AVG and Microsoft Security Essentials are good free options for Windows. Windows 10 includes adequate Anti-Virus Software)

    • 4-Year Next Business Day On-Site Warranty with Accidental Damage Protection (this would be ideal)

    ## Warranty Options

    The purchase of a laptop computer is as much an investment in the student’s education as is tuition, room, and board. The computer will be with them for the duration of their stay at The Master's University and plays a vital role in all their educational pursuits while at the school. Students should plan on purchasing a new computer with a service contract (warranty) for the duration of the student’s intended stay at school, or as long as the student plans to keep the laptop.

    Many students purchase a high-quality notebook their freshman year with a four-year warranty and use that laptop for the duration of their time at Master's. An ideal warranty would run this length and include accidental damage protection. The service contract is a critical part of the computer purchase. This will ensure that the student will always have a means of support in case of a hardware failure. Many computer manufacturers sell next business day warranties which facilitate timely service. Due to the breadth of laptop manufacturers today, The Master’s University does not have the necessary resources to service student computers. However, IT Operations will do their utmost to ensure that all students are able to successfully connect to and utilize university technology resources.

    ## Accidental Damage

    Warranties do not cover all repairs to your notebook computer; they are expressly written to cover manufacturers' defects that cause system failure during the normal use and life cycle of the product. If you damage your notebook computer by dropping it, stepping on it, spilling liquids on it, etc., you are liable for the repair costs to restore the notebook to working condition. Some manufacturers offer accidental damage plans that you can purchase in addition to extended warranty plans. Although an accidental damage plan may seem expensive at first, it could be a very valuable investment considering the cost of repairs.

    ## Service Availability

    You may also want to consider the service options that are available with a particular computer. If you encounter problems or defects in your laptop, you may have to deal directly with the manufacturer by telephone, or you may have to take the computer to the store you bought it from in order to have any troubleshooting done. If there is a hardware problem with your computer, you may need to leave it at the store or ship your computer to the manufacturer for repairs. Some notebook manufacturers also offer on-site warranty repairs where they will come to your place of residence within 24 to 48 hours with the necessary replacement parts.

    Students bringing their own notebooks to campus will be responsible for their own hardware troubleshooting and tech support, which can be obtained from the the manufacturer or vendor where the notebook was purchased. IT Operations does not offer any hardware tech support for student owned notebooks other than assistance in connecting to the wireless network.

    ## Additional Resources

    Popular laptop manufacturers include Dell and Apple. Student discounts may be found at the following websites: [http://www.delluniversity.com/](http://www.delluniversity.com/) and [http://store.apple.com/us_edu_270448](http://store.apple.com/us_edu_270448).

- title: Media Ethics Policy
  body: |-
    ## I. Philosophy

    Learning to grow in the knowledge and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the mission of Christian higher education. We want to educate the heart as well as the mind, desiring to maintain an atmosphere that will be conducive to the development of spiritual maturity and discernment. Because each student coming to The Master’s University professes faith in Jesus Christ, we expect students to grow in that faith through the work of the Holy Spirit.

    The Master's University is committed to developing its students into people who obey biblical mandates because they are personally accountable to God and His Word rather than to man alone. University policies are designed by the administration to facilitate an educational environment which honors the Lord.

    The student, by virtue of their signature on the application for admission, agrees to live within the framework of the standards of the university both on and off campus while each semester is in session. Though one’s personal convictions may differ with these standards, a student’s choice to become a part of The Master's University community implies a commitment to abide by the established policies.

    God calls all believers to submit to the governing authorities (this includes federal, state, and/or local governments and their respective legislation). Romans 13 directs, "Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God…render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor" (vv. 1, 7). Current laws governing the use of technology require students to honor these laws as a mandate regardless of personal opinion. Students who are in violation of such laws will face the consequences of campus discipline, as well as, legal liability.

    ## II. Definitions

    Electronic Media - Any electronic medium, including but not limited to: email text, chat, email attachments, gaming, web page viewing, video files, audio files, or computer/program files.

    The Master's University Network - Any University computer, server, software, program, facility or the hardware/equipment involved in the interconnection and inter-operation of these items, or any said device connected to any such device at The Master's University(for example, any laptop/PC connected to the University wired/wireless network).

    Hacking - Defined as attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or data – this includes any unauthorized attempt to incapacitate, interrupt, view, alter, copy or delete systems, networks or data.

    "Video" - Defined as watching audio/visual content (or files of such) via PC, DVD player, Blu-ray player, Television, or any other equipment.

    "Foreign" Media - Defined as data, images, programs, games, viruses, etc. which did not originally reside on the University network.

    Texting - Refers to the exchange of brief written messages between fixed-line phone or mobile phone and fixed or portable devices over a network.

    ## III. Guidelines

    Any “unwholesome” \[i.e. actions inconsistent with our profession as Christ’s followers committed to holiness, truth, and the proper stewardship of His blessings (possessions, time, etc.)\] use of Electronic Media which may include, but not be limited to: email text, chat, email attachments, video files, audio files, electronic/internet gaming, web page viewing or file transfers is expressly forbidden.

    Email - Electronic mail which meets the following criteria is prohibited:

    Spamming - An attempt by any student(s) to issue unsolicited bulk email to other students, or to anyone outside of The Master's University.

    Spoofing - Any attempt to send an email which appears to have originated from someone other than the actual sender. Unrelated to email, prohibited “spoofing” also includes any attempt to impersonate/borrow another user’s login.

    Internet & University Network - Internet & University Network/Content Management use is restricted in the following ways:

    Web Page viewing - Viewing http, https, ftp, or any Internet site regardless of protocol with illegal, pornographic, or any other immoral material is prohibited.

    Chat - Any application used for “Internet Messaging” or “Instant Messaging” cannot be used for illegal file trading (including, but not limited to audio/video files) or to send illicit messages to anyone.

    Uploading & Downloading of any type of electronic media file - The use of the Internet or the University Network for uploading and/or downloading files which contain unwholesome or illegal content is prohibited. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO: ANY CONTENT WHICH IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT LAW. Therefore, any file sharing involving music, video, audio, computer programs, etc. in which the distributor of the media (web page/site or server) is not a legal and officially licensed distributor of the media is PROHIBITED. Stated alternately, all “pirated” material is clearly prohibited. Simply because media is accessible, or free of charge, does not make it legal. Whether an individual “thinks” such a file transfer/download is legal is irrelevant; Copyright Law indicates it is stealing.

    The illegal distribution of copyrighted materials, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject students to criminal and civil penalties. A summary of the penalties for violation of Federal copyright laws can be found at http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html. Any student found to be in violation of these policies could be subject to institutional discipline in addition to criminal and civil penalties.

    Hacking - Any usage of the University Network for activities that are directly or indirectly, advertently or inadvertently considered “hacking” are prohibited. Any attempt to bypass security or content restrictions (such as web page filtering) is considered “hacking.”

    Foreign Media -Any attempt to introduce “foreign”, harmful, and/or inappropriate media to The Master’s University Network is clearly prohibited (this includes, but is not limited to: viruses, worms, etc.). Complete responsibility for such actions lies with the student(s) who introduce it. Intentional introduction will be treated as hacking and the destruction of property.

    Usage for Internet/Server -The University network is not to be used to set up a personal “server.” The server prohibition includes, but is not limited to: file sharing, DCHP, WINS, DNS, Directory Services and Web Services. For an extended definition, see the [Network Use Policy](https://athletics.masters.edu/%7BlocalLink:1517%7D "NetworkUse").

    Phone Usage - Illicit or harassing phone calls are prohibited. This includes calls to phone services with sexual content, or any type of inappropriate calls with/to other students.

    Texting - Illicit or harassing texting is prohibited. This includes texts with sexual content, or any type of inappropriate texts with/to other students.

    Printing/Scanning - Printing or scanning or illegal, pornographic, or any other immoral material is prohibited.

    ## IV. Consequences

    Each student bears full responsibility for his/her actions as they relate to the use of the University Network or any electronic media. Discipline for all infractions of the Media Ethics Policy will be under the direction of Student Life. This may include, but is not limited to, the suspension and/or revocation of network and Internet access and services.

    All legal consequences involving the use/misuse of the University Network or equipment lie solely with the user.

    The cost of damages caused by any student(s) enrolled at The Master's University will be born solely by the student(s) responsible individually; they shall not hold the university responsible in any way for their use/misuse of the Network whatever the ramifications of that use/misuse.

    Departures from the Media Ethics policy or any misuse of the University Network which may by “technicality” fall outside of this policy but which remain within the moral, ethical, and spiritual guidelines intended by the “spirit” of this policy are subject to discipline.
- title: 'Network Use '
  body: |-
    ## TMU IT Student Network Use Policy

    IT Operations strives to provide students with the computer technology they need to succeed in their studies at The Master's University. All students have a responsibility to use the University's computer resources and the Internet in a professional, lawful and ethical manner.

    Students at The Master's University have access to the following resources:

    * Internet

    * Office 365

    * Printers

    The Master's University students can access these resources from their personally owned devices via the WiFi infrastructure or through various computer labs on the campus. With access to these resources comes the responsibility to use them wisely. The University network is a resource that is shared by students, faculty, and staff. Students should not use network resources in a disruptive manner (e.g., forwarding junk email, sending spam, etc.).

    ## Network Infrastructure

    All installed wireless access points and antennas are the property of The Master's University. Do not tamper with, adjust, abuse, repair, or otherwise touch these access points and their antennas. Due to the presence of this equipment in dorm rooms, hallways and other public areas, residents should be very careful about horseplay, throwing objects, and other activities which may potentially cause equipment damage.

    All network printers, wireless access points, and TMU-owned computers employ secure wired network connections. No person is authorized to use, unplug or tamper with these hardwire connections for any purpose.

    ## Network Access

    All network, Internet, and email usage is not private and is monitored. IT Operations staff have the right to examine any files that are transmitted or stored through or on University computer network or storage infrastructure or cloud-based services provided by The Master's University. Any questionable usage or activity will be immediately reported to Student Life.

    Each student will be provided with a username and password that will be required for the use of any network resource which requires authentication. Students are responsible to protect their password from unauthorized use; to prevent this, passwords should not be printed, stored on-line, or given to others. Users will be held responsible for all operations that take place under their user account.

    Students are not allowed for any purpose to obtain and/or use any login account that is not their own. Students must obtain permission from the owner of any file before viewing or altering its contents. Just because you can obtain the ability to read, alter, or copy a file does not imply that you have permission to read, alter, or copy that file.

    Students may not attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any University system or network, or breach or attempt to breach security or authentication measures. Students are prohibited from accessing any network infrastructure, systems, or data that are not explicitly intended for student use.

    Students are prohibited from modifying or attempting to modify computer lab systems. In addition, students are prohibited from accessing or attempting to access other students’ data on computer lab systems.

    Students are not allowed to set up any form of proxy service or other such arrangement to enable more than one computer to access the network via a wireless connection. In addition, students are not allowed to set up any type of server or server operating system on computers that are connected to the network. This includes, but is not limited to, the following services:

    * DHCP

    * DNS

    * Web Servers

    The Master's University takes copyright issues seriously, and seeks to be in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Therefore, if you willingly use P2P file sharing applications such as uTorrent, BitTorrent, Vuze or applications of like nature to either acquire or distribute content that you have not purchased or possess the right to distribute, you may be subject to criminal and civil penalties.

    Copying and distributing digital forms of original work for which you do not own the copyright or have permission of the copyright holder violates federal law. Civil fines can be in the range of many thousands of dollars. Willful violations can result in criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. A summary of the penalties for violation of Federal copyright laws can be found at here.

    If a student is identified as having illegally distributed copyrighted content, the following penalties may be applied.

    * Student may receive a written notice and warning about the violation.

    * The student's network connection may be immediately terminated.

    * Network access may be suspended until the situation is rectified.

    * Network access may be suspended for a specified period of time.

    * Violations may be reported to Student Life which may result in further, more serious penalties.

    Because of legal, security and bandwidth issues, computers with installed and active peer to peer file sharing applications will not be allowed access to the Master's University network.

    Students may not use University computer resources for commercial purposes, except for incidental work such as posting a resume or communicating with an employer via email.

    IT Operations staff has the authority to throttle bandwidth and/or terminate connections that monopolize resources in order to provide a stable computing environment for campus users.

    Students will be held responsible for any network or system activities that violate local, state or federal law.

    ## Malware Prevention

    It is the responsibility of the student to protect their devices from dangerous malware that may disrupt University network infrastructure. Students need to exercise caution when interacting with unverified resources and quickly remove malware from their systems once it has been detected.

    ## Blocking Sites with Inappropriate Content

    The Master's University has the right to utilize hardware and software that makes it possible to identify and block access to Internet sites containing sexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate.

    ## Communications

    While using University network or system infrastructure, students are prohibited from sending spam or inappropriate messages through mediums such as email, social media, chat, etc. In addition, all communications must not intentionally hide where and whom the message originated from. Students are prohibited from engaging in messaging that is obscene or defamatory, or with intent to annoy, harass, or alarm.

    IT Operations reserves the right to filter, refuse, or discard email from outside hosts that send unsolicited, mass, or commercial messages, or messages that appear to contain viruses.

    ## Printing

    A printing charge has been instituted that applies to all University printers found in the dormitories and at various locations across campus. Each student starts the semester with a credit balance of 300 pages. If your printing needs surpass this amount, you will be able to purchase additional pages from the Student Finance Center or the Library.

    If there is a printing problem that consumes student credits, the issue must be reported to the IT Operations Service Desk (servicedesk@masters.edu) within 2 days to receive credit.

    Please include the following information:

    * Name

    * Date of Print Job

    * Number of Pages Printed

    * Printer

    Unused printing credits cannot be carried over to the next semester. At the beginning of each semester your balance will be reset to 300 pages. Please be aware that color prints cost more printing credits than black and white prints.

    ## Account Security

    Users are typically assigned usernames and passwords for access to University network and system resources. Accounts are provided for exclusive use of the specific individual to whom they have been assigned. Transfer, possession, or use of account information that has been assigned to another individual is not permitted. Use of any Master's University account constitutes giving one’s word as the appropriate user of that account and signifies acceptance of the purposes outlined in this policy.

    ## System Security

    Services provided through the University's networks have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our networks and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party hackers from illegally obtaining this information.

    ## Policy Violations

    Students who violate the above stated policies may be subject to one or more of the following disciplinary actions:

    * Student may receive a written notice and warning about the violation.

    * The student's network connection may be immediately terminated.

    * Network access may be suspended until the situation is rectified.

    * Network access may be suspended for a specified period of time.

    * Replacement/repair costs for damage to TMU-owned property will be charged to the responsible students' accounts.

    * Violations may be reported to Student Life and/or TMU Administration which may result in disciplinary action, including possible expulsion, and civil and/or criminal liability.
