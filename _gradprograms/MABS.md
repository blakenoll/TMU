  The M.A. in Biblical Studies is a 36 credit hour graduate degree program, designed to allow students to pursue in-depth training in Biblical Studies.

  ## Course Formats

  Courses are pursued through a combination of on-campus, correspondence, and travel-study courses. The program is designed to give students maximum flexibility in progressing through the degree while also strategically offering instruction in the format best suited for effective educational training. With these available formats, the entire degree may be earned without relocating to Southern California.

  Courses which are only offered on-campus--because of their unique advantage in a traditional classroom setting--are pursued through our intensive courses (courses which meet intensively for 1 week on campus in July and from a distance the rest of the term--formerly known as our "Summer Intensive Program"). Twenty four (24) units must be completed on campus. The remaining 12 units are completed by correspondence or travel-study format.

  Intensive courses (available only during the Summer term only) are designed to serve those in various parts of the world who are entrenched in their current ministries and without the ability to relocate to Southern California. These summer term courses extend from May to August, but intensive lectures and classroom dialogue are conducted in a single week period always scheduled during the last two weeks of July. Preparatory and follow-up studies surround the intensive week. Students are encouraged to take four courses each summer (which include two weeks of intensive class meetings) in order to complete the on-campus requirement in 2 1/2 years.

  During the fall and spring terms, students will take their correspondence courses or travel-study courses.

  ## Program Length

  The program is optimally completed in two to four years, but program length may depend on the student's own schedule and external commitments. Typically, students complete their course work in a three to four year period. The degree *must *be completed within six years of enrollment.
