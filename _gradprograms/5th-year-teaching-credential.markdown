  Teaching Credential Programs

  ### *Multiple Subject Teaching Credential Program –* for those who want to teach at the elementary school level

  ### *Single Subject Teaching Credential Program – *for those who want to teach at the secondary (junior high/high school) level

  Each is a 30-unit, two-semester, cohort-style program with a start date in early Fall (early August).

  For important admissions criteria and procedures, including tuition and fees, please visit the [Credential Programs Admissions](https://www.masters.edu/academics/teaching-credential-programs/credential-program-admissions/ "Credential Program Admissions") page.

  The credential programs follow the [TMU Credential Program Calendar](https://www.masters.edu/media/870039/teaching-credential-program-calendar-fa17-sp18-candidates-copy.pdf "Teaching Credential Program Calendar"), designed to align with local school district calendars rather than the TMU undergraduate calendar. Accordingly, the credential programs begin earlier and finish later than the TMU undergraduate programs. See important dates on the calendar.

  Though they are fifth-year undergraduate programs, the credential programs maintain graduate-level quality and graduate-level expectations, resulting in high-quality preparation for teaching. As a result, our credential program alumni are well-qualified for teaching positions in public, private, and international schools, and are in high demand locally and elsewhere.

  Credential Program-plus-Master’s Degree pathway. Students who successfully complete a TMU credential program may apply for admission to the online TMU Master of Education degree program and transfer in up to 19 units of credential coursework toward that degree, meaning only 5 additional courses would be needed to earn the M.Ed degree. For more information, see the [TMU Online](http://www.masters.edu/academics/online.aspx "Online Education") page, or contact us.

  TUITION AND FEES:

  Tuition for credential program: $13,800 ($7,360/fall semester and $6440/spring semester).

  Credential Programs Admissions

  Who are our successful candidates for admission? In general, they are diligent students who achieve high levels of academic success in college, and who are:

  * Committed to the Christian walk; while they are prepared to live in the world, they are not of the world - they are committed to a biblical worldview, displaying their faith in their lifestyle.

  * Passionate about student success; while they love their content area(s), they love their students more, and are committed to using best practices to teach all students appointed to their care.

  * Reflective, relational, and self-aware; while they are already academically and socially successful, they recognize that they are still growing, and are committed to life-long professional development as teachers.

  * Humble leaders; while they are confident and capable in the classroom, they are committed to seeking out, accepting graciously, and applying constructive feedback.

  CLINICAL PRACTICE

  Clinical practice is a significant component of the TMU Credential Programs. From the beginning of their program, candidates are placed in public school classrooms for hands-on work with teachers and students. This enables candidates to gain experience working with students, make connections between courses and the real world of teaching, and evaluate their own desire and ability to teach. TMU cooperates with local public school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley to provide candidates both fieldwork and student teaching experiences. Local school and district leaders participate in TMU’s Credential Programs Community Advisory Panel, ensuring strong communication and collaboration between the university and the local education community.

  ## PLACEMENTS

  ### Fall Semester Clinical Practice Placements (Fieldwork)

  Multiple subject candidates complete one 7-week placement in a primary grade classroom (usually K-2) and one 7-week placement in an upper grade classroom (usually 4-6). Required placement hours are from the start of school day until lunchtime, Monday – Thursday, approximately 8am – noon.

  Single subject candidates complete one 7-week placement in a high school and one 7-week placement in a junior high. Placement hours vary by school site; the candidate is responsible for coordinating a schedule the equivalent of three periods, four days per week, usually Monday - Thursday. The goal is to “adopt” three classes and follow their schedule.

  ### Spring Semester Clinical Practice Placements (Student Teaching)

  Multiple subject candidates complete one 8-week placement in a primary grade classroom (usually K-2) and one 8-week placement in an upper grade classroom (usually 4-6). Required placement hours are full day, Monday – Friday.

  Single subject candidates complete one 8-week placement in a high school and one 8-week placement in a junior high. Required placement hours are full day, Monday – Friday.

  ### Clinical Practice Placement Arrangements

  The state mandates certain requirements for clinical practice, including qualifications of master teachers, characteristics of school sites, and classroom demographics. TMU is required to have a formal agreement with a clinical practice school district. Since TMU is responsible for ensuring that clinical practice placements meet state requirements, all placements must be arranged by TMU, and TMU only arranges clinical practice placements in the local public school districts listed below. Official contacts for placements are made by the Credential Analyst.

  ### School District Partners

  Multiple Subject candidates are placed in the following elementary school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley:

  * Newhall

  * Saugus

  * Sulphur Springs

  * Castaic

  Single Subject candidates are placed in the secondary school district in the Santa Clarita Valley:

  * William S. Hart Union High School District

  ### Clinical Practice Handbook

  For more information about clinical practice in the TMU Credential Programs, download the [Credential Program Handbook](https://www.masters.edu/media/870037/credential-program-handbook-for-candidates-2017-18-03132017.pdf "Credential Program Handbook for Candidates 2017-2018").
handbook-body: "Credential Program Handbook\\\n\\\n\n## TMU Student Handbook\n\nCandidates
  in the TMU credential programs are bound by policies and procedures in the TMU Student
  Handbook. Credential program candidates are not considered to be “on contract”,
  but are expected and required to abide by the Standard of Conduct policies found
  in the TMU Student Handbook.[http://www.masters.edu/media/868124/2016-masters-u-handbook-updated.pdf](http://www.masters.edu/media/868124/2016-masters-u-handbook-updated.pdf)\n\n##
  Chapel and Church Attendance\n\nCandidates are not required to attend TMU chapel
  or the Truth & Life Conference, but candidates may attend as long as attendance
  does not conflict with program responsibilities.\n\nRegular church attendance is
  expected and encouraged, but is not monitored.\n\n## Candidate Housing\n\nCandidates
  are responsible for making their own housing arrangements. Candidates may not live
  in the TMU dorms, but may live in other TMU housing (such as the International House).
  If candidates live in TMU housing, they may be considered “on contract.” Consult
  the TMU Student Handbook and/or contact the Office of Student Life for details.\n\n##
  \n\n## Candidate Transportation\n\nCandidates are responsible for their own transportation.
  Since a significant component of the program is clinical practice, requiring daily
  attendance at a school site away from the TMU campus, candidates should ensure they
  have guaranteed access to their own reliable car.\n\n## Candidate Dress Code\n\nCandidates
  are required to follow the TMU Class Dress Code while attending classes on the TMU
  campus. (See the TMU Student Handbook for details).\n\nCandidates are required to
  dress modestly and professionally at school sites. Jeans, flip flops/sandals, and
  t-shirts are not allowed. Candidates must also dress in ways that will enable them
  to teach effectively, especially while stooping, bending, leaning over desks, sitting
  on the floor, having knees at students’ eye levels, etc. Candidates should seek
  to demonstrate dedication to the professional teaching profession in the way they
  dress.\n\n## Extracurricular Activities, Additional Classes, and/or Work\n\nThough
  engaging and effective, the workload of the credential programs is demanding, as
  they are full-time programs of graduate-level quality. Expectations for scholarship
  are greater than in an undergraduate program. For these reasons, candidates are
  encouraged to carefully evaluate their time commitments to other activities. Candidates
  in the program should carefully select and if necessary limit any extracurricular
  activities. Commitments made to optional responsibilities (ministries, community
  work, friends, etc.) must be flexible, based on the amount of time needed to complete
  all program responsibilities.\n\nCandidates may not take other classes while in
  the program and may not participate in intercollegiate athletics.\n\nCandidates
  may work no more than 10 hours per week during the Fall semester of the program.\n\nCandidates
  are not allowed to work during the Spring semester of the program (student teaching).
  Candidates may petition for exception at admission prior to the start of Fall semester,
  or at the time of formal advancement to Spring semester. Exceptions will be granted
  on a case-by-case, need-centered basis at the sole discretion of the program.\n\nSubstitute
  Teaching\n\nTMU allows candidates to substitute teach during the program, as long
  as the candidate’s clinical practice district allows it, and as long as doing so
  does not conflict with program responsibilities such as attending classes and completing
  hours of clinical practice. To substitute teach, the candidate must have a valid
  substitute teaching credential. It is the candidate’s responsibility to obtain the
  appropriate substitute credential, submitting verification to the Credential Analyst.\n\nDuring
  Fall semester, candidates may substitute teach only for their assigned master teacher
  Monday-Thursday (or the days candidates are scheduled to be in the fieldwork placement
  classroom). Candidates may substitute teach for any teacher/any district on Fridays
  or on any day(s) candidates are not required to be in their fieldwork classroom.\n\nDuring
  Spring semester, candidates will be student teaching full day, so they may only
  substitute teach for their assigned master teacher."
