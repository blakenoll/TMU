  ## CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS INFORMATION:

  ## FALL SEMESTER

  During the first (Fall) semester, sometimes referred to as the Fieldwork Semester, credential program students (candidates) take a full-time course load of professional education courses covering specific subject matter strategies, including how to teach students who are learning English and/or who have special needs in the regular classroom. The courses are designed to be practical, emphasizing the development of teaching skills.

  In addition to Fall coursework, candidates also complete clinical practice (fieldwork) in two grade levels, paired with veteran master teachers in local public schools. Starting with classroom set-up and preparation prior to the start of school, candidates are both coached and evaluated on potential teaching ability throughout the semester. The program intentionally creates a strong connection between courses and clinical practice. Candidates are asked to reflect on and apply what they are learning in their courses to clinical practice, and vice versa. For more information on clinical practice, visit the Clinical Practice page.

  ## SPRING SEMESTER

  In the second (Spring) semester, sometimes referred to as the Student Teaching Semester, candidates are placed back in their Fall semester public school classrooms for all-day student teaching. In addition, candidates take the Student Teaching Colloquium course. As they assume most day-to-day responsibilities of full-time teaching, candidates are coached and formally evaluated on teaching skills throughout this semester.

  ### CANDIDATE TRANSITION PLAN

  As part of the credential program requirements, at the end of the program candidates will meet with TMU program faculty to create a Candidate Transition Plan. This document will outline the candidate’s strengths and areas of future growth relative to the state’s [Teaching Performance Expectations](https://www.ctc.ca.gov/docs/default-source/educator-prep/standards/adopted-tpes-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8cb2c410_0 "California Teaching Performance Expectations"). Candidates who are employed in California will use this plan to begin their Induction program to clear their preliminary credential.

  ## CALIFORNIA TEACHING CREDENTIALS

  Upon completion of a California teaching credential program, candidates are recommended by their college or university to the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).

  At the end of their TMU Credential program, the candidate submits a Credential Recommendation Request to the Credential Analyst at TMU in order to be begin the recommendation process.The Master’s University is required to abide by the regulations and requirements of the CTC, as is the teaching credential candidate. Though it is the candidate’s responsibility to remain aware of and meet the credential requirements of the CTC, the programs provide guidance and support to candidates in meeting these requirements.

  Upon receipt of the Credential Recommendation Request, the Credential Analyst will complete a review of the candidate’s status at program completion, verifying the following:

  * Completion of all program and credential requirements, including passing all required exams (including TPAs)

  * Completion of all program courses with minimum grade of B[-](https://www.masters.edu/umbraco/#_msocom_5)

  * Passing score on the RICA exam (multiple subject candidates only)

  * Successful completion of student teaching (passing grades), including receipt of all required evaluation forms from master teachers and university supervisor(s)

  * Completion of Candidate Transition Plan

  * Accuracy of “Credential Recommendation Request” submitted by candidate

  NOTE: in addition to program completion requirements as outlined previously, multiple subject credential candidates must pass the Reading Instruction Competency Assessment (RICA exam) and submit official scores in order to be eligible to be recommended for the credential. Multiple subject candidates are provided with information about and preparation for this exam in their Fall semester ED510 course.

  After an exit interview with the candidate ensuring all of the requirements are met, the credential analyst will submit a recommendation to the CTC for the candidate. The candidate will receive an email from the CTC when the recommendation is made, and will then complete his or her portion of the recommendation online and pay the required fees. (This online process requires payment be made by a Visa, MasterCard, or Debit Card with a Visa or MasterCard logo.) When the candidate has successfully completed his or her portion and paid the required fees, he or she will receive email verification of the completed process. Finally, the candidate will receive email notification from the CTC when the credential is granted.

  ### OFFICIAL NAMES/TYPES OF CREDENTIALS

  The TMU Credential Programs prepare students for the following credentials:

  California Preliminary 2042 Multiple Subject Teaching Credential

  Teachers in elementary schools need a Multiple Subject Credential, as they usually teach multiple subjects to the same group of students in a self-contained classroom. (The Multiple Subject credential includes authorization for the holder to teach English learners in the regular classroom.)

  California Preliminary 2042 Single Subject Teaching Credential

  Teachers in junior high or senior high schools need a Single Subject Credential in the subject area they wish to teach, as they usually teach a single subject to different groups of students (classes) in a departmentalized setting. (The 2042 Single Subject credential includes authorization for the holder to teach English learners in the regular classroom.)

  ### LEVELS OF CREDENTIALS

  Preliminary Credential

  Candidates are recommended for a preliminary credential by The Master’s University upon satisfactory completion of a credential program. The Preliminary Credential is valid for five years, during which time candidates can be employed as teachers while completing the requirements needed for the Clear Credential (the next and final level) through a state-approved program.

  Clear Credential

  Currently, holders of a Preliminary Credential have three options to obtain a Clear Credential. More information about each of these options is available at the CTC website ([www.ctc.ca.gov](http://www.ctc.ca.gov/))

  Option 1: A CTC-approved Teacher Induction Program through an approved school district, county office of education, college or university, consortium, or private school. This is the most common option.

  Option 2: A CTC-approved Clear Credential or Induction Program through a university or other sponsoring agency. Individuals receive that institution's formal recommendation for the clear credential.

  Option 3: Certification by the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards in a qualifying subject.

  ### Additional Authorizations

  Once a person is granted a multiple subject or a single subject credential by the CTC, it is possible to obtain additional authorizations to teach in additional subject areas. Check with the Credential Analyst to find out more about this process.

  ### Candidate Files

  The credential programs maintain electronic files for all candidates. In addition to required program forms and records, candidates may add to their file letters of recommendation from principals, teachers, or other school site personnel who observe them teaching during clinical practice.

  CLINICAL PRACTICE

  Clinical practice is a significant component of the TMU Credential Programs. From the beginning of their program, candidates are placed in public school classrooms for hands-on work with teachers and students. This enables candidates to gain experience working with students, make connections between courses and the real world of teaching, and evaluate their own desire and ability to teach. TMU cooperates with local public school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley to provide candidates both fieldwork and student teaching experiences. Local school and district leaders participate in TMU’s Credential Programs Community Advisory Panel, ensuring strong communication and collaboration between the university and the local education community.

  ## PLACEMENTS

  ### Fall Semester Clinical Practice Placements (Fieldwork)

  Multiple subject candidates complete one 7-week placement in a primary grade classroom (usually K-2) and one 7-week placement in an upper grade classroom (usually 4-6). Required placement hours are from the start of school day until lunchtime, Monday – Thursday, approximately 8am – noon.

  Single subject candidates complete one 7-week placement in a high school and one 7-week placement in a junior high. Placement hours vary by school site; the candidate is responsible for coordinating a schedule the equivalent of three periods, four days per week, usually Monday - Thursday. The goal is to “adopt” three classes and follow their schedule.

  ### Spring Semester Clinical Practice Placements (Student Teaching)

  Multiple subject candidates complete one 8-week placement in a primary grade classroom (usually K-2) and one 8-week placement in an upper grade classroom (usually 4-6). Required placement hours are full day, Monday – Friday.

  Single subject candidates complete one 8-week placement in a high school and one 8-week placement in a junior high. Required placement hours are full day, Monday – Friday.

  ### Clinical Practice Placement Arrangements

  The state mandates certain requirements for clinical practice, including qualifications of master teachers, characteristics of school sites, and classroom demographics. TMU is required to have a formal agreement with a clinical practice school district. Since TMU is responsible for ensuring that clinical practice placements meet state requirements, all placements must be arranged by TMU, and TMU only arranges clinical practice placements in the local public school districts listed below. Official contacts for placements are made by the Credential Analyst.

  ### School District Partners

  Multiple Subject candidates are placed in the following elementary school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley:

  * Newhall

  * Saugus

  * Sulphur Springs

  * Castaic

  Single Subject candidates are placed in the secondary school district in the Santa Clarita Valley:

  * William S. Hart Union High School District

  ### Clinical Practice Handbook

  ## TMU Student Handbook

  Candidates in the TMU credential programs are bound by policies and procedures in the TMU Student Handbook. Credential program candidates are not considered to be “on contract”, but are expected and required to abide by the Standard of Conduct policies found in the TMU Student Handbook.[http://www.masters.edu/media/868124/2016-masters-u-handbook-updated.pdf](http://www.masters.edu/media/868124/2016-masters-u-handbook-updated.pdf)

  ## Chapel and Church Attendance

  Candidates are not required to attend TMU chapel or the Truth & Life Conference, but candidates may attend as long as attendance does not conflict with program responsibilities.

  Regular church attendance is expected and encouraged, but is not monitored.

  ## Candidate Housing

  Candidates are responsible for making their own housing arrangements. Candidates may not live in the TMU dorms, but may live in other TMU housing (such as the International House). If candidates live in TMU housing, they may be considered “on contract.” Consult the TMU Student Handbook and/or contact the Office of Student Life for details.


  ## Candidate Transportation

  Candidates are responsible for their own transportation. Since a significant component of the program is clinical practice, requiring daily attendance at a school site away from the TMU campus, candidates should ensure they have guaranteed access to their own reliable car.

  ## Candidate Dress Code

  Candidates are required to follow the TMU Class Dress Code while attending classes on the TMU campus. (See the TMU Student Handbook for details).

  Candidates are required to dress modestly and professionally at school sites. Jeans, flip flops/sandals, and t-shirts are not allowed. Candidates must also dress in ways that will enable them to teach effectively, especially while stooping, bending, leaning over desks, sitting on the floor, having knees at students’ eye levels, etc. Candidates should seek to demonstrate dedication to the professional teaching profession in the way they dress.

  ## Extracurricular Activities, Additional Classes, and/or Work

  Though engaging and effective, the workload of the credential programs is demanding, as they are full-time programs of graduate-level quality. Expectations for scholarship are greater than in an undergraduate program. For these reasons, candidates are encouraged to carefully evaluate their time commitments to other activities. Candidates in the program should carefully select and if necessary limit any extracurricular activities. Commitments made to optional responsibilities (ministries, community work, friends, etc.) must be flexible, based on the amount of time needed to complete all program responsibilities.

  Candidates may not take other classes while in the program and may not participate in intercollegiate athletics.

  Candidates may work no more than 10 hours per week during the Fall semester of the program.

  Candidates are not allowed to work during the Spring semester of the program (student teaching). Candidates may petition for exception at admission prior to the start of Fall semester, or at the time of formal advancement to Spring semester. Exceptions will be granted on a case-by-case, need-centered basis at the sole discretion of the program.

  Substitute Teaching

  TMU allows candidates to substitute teach during the program, as long as the candidate’s clinical practice district allows it, and as long as doing so does not conflict with program responsibilities such as attending classes and completing hours of clinical practice. To substitute teach, the candidate must have a valid substitute teaching credential. It is the candidate’s responsibility to obtain the appropriate substitute credential, submitting verification to the Credential Analyst.

  During Fall semester, candidates may substitute teach only for their assigned master teacher Monday-Thursday (or the days candidates are scheduled to be in the fieldwork placement classroom). Candidates may substitute teach for any teacher/any district on Fridays or on any day(s) candidates are not required to be in their fieldwork classroom.

  During Spring semester, candidates will be student teaching full day, so they may only substitute teach for their assigned master teacher.

## Teaching Credential Programs

### *Multiple Subject Teaching Credential Program –* for those who want to teach at the elementary school level

### Single Subject Teaching Credential Program – for those who want to teach at the secondary (junior high/high school) level

Each is a 30-unit, two-semester, cohort-style program with a start date in early Fall (early August).

For important admissions criteria and procedures, including tuition and fees, please visit the [Credential Programs Admissions](https://www.masters.edu/academics/teaching-credential-programs/credential-program-admissions/ "Credential Program Admissions") page.

The credential programs follow the [TMU Credential Program Calendar](https://www.masters.edu/media/870039/teaching-credential-program-calendar-fa17-sp18-candidates-copy.pdf "Teaching Credential Program Calendar"), designed to align with local school district calendars rather than the TMU undergraduate calendar. Accordingly, the credential programs begin earlier and finish later than the TMU undergraduate programs. See important dates on the calendar.

Though they are fifth-year undergraduate programs, the credential programs maintain graduate-level quality and graduate-level expectations, resulting in high-quality preparation for teaching. As a result, our credential program alumni are well-qualified for teaching positions in public, private, and international schools, and are in high demand locally and elsewhere.

Credential Program-plus-Master’s Degree pathway. Students who successfully complete a TMU credential program may apply for admission to the online TMU Master of Education degree program and transfer in up to 19 units of credential coursework toward that degree, meaning only 5 additional courses would be needed to earn the M.Ed degree. For more information, see the [TMU Online](http://www.masters.edu/academics/online.aspx "Online Education") page, or contact us.
