title: MABC
program-outline-text: "The M.A. in Biblical Counseling is a 34 credit hour graduate
  degree program, designed to allow students to pursue in-depth training in Biblical
  Counseling.\n\nCourse Formats\n\nCourses are pursued through a combination of on-campus
  and distance education courses. The program is designed to give students maximum
  flexibility in progressing through the degree while also strategically offering
  instruction in the format best suited for effective educational training--serving
  both distance and local students. With these available formats, the entire degree
  may be earned without relocating to Southern California, although local students
  may experience additional mentoring because of their proximity to campus and additional
  ministry connections with the faculty.\n\nCourses which are only offered on-campus--because
  of their unique advantage in a traditional classroom setting--may be pursued either
  through weekly meetings (courses meeting once a week for a 15-week period), or through
  intensive meetings (courses which meet intensively for 1 week on campus in July
  and from a distance the rest of the term--formerly known as our \"Summer Intensive
  Program\").\n\nWeekly courses are designed to serve residents of the greater Los
  Angeles area especially or others who are able to move to the area. Courses are
  held in the evenings Mondays through Thursdays, allowing students to continue to
  work in their present occupations and ministries while completing their degree program.\n\nIntensive
  courses (available only during the Summer term) are designed to serve distance students
  especially, those in various parts of the world who are entrenched in their current
  ministries and without the ability to relocate to Southern California. Courses extend
  from May to August, but intensive lectures and classroom dialogue are conducted
  in a single week period always scheduled during the last two weeks of July. Preparatory
  and follow-up studies surround the intensive week. Students are encouraged to take
  four courses each summer (which include two weeks of intensive class meetings) in
  order to complete the on-campus requirement in 2 years. Each student will present
  his masterâ€™s thesis to the faculty and fellow students on-campus during the week
  of graduation, which is always held at the beginning of May. \n\nProgram Length\n\nThe
  program is optimally completed in two to four years, but program length may depend
  on the student's own schedule and external commitments. Typically, students complete
  their course work over a two to three year period, and their internship and research
  in an additional year. The degree must be completed within six years of enrollment.\n\nProgram
  Framework\n\nThe M.A. in Biblical Counseling is awarded to students who succesfully
  fulfill the requirements of the following courses.\n\nPre-Requisite Course (Credits)\n\nBC090

  BC501 - INTRO TO BIBLICAL COUNSELING

  This course offers a general introduction to basic concepts and distinctive features of biblical counseling. Students will discuss what biblical counseling is and what it involves, the role of the counselor in biblical counseling, the different kinds of counseling that are needed, the place of counseling in the ministry of the church and how biblical counseling theory and practice relate to and differ from some of the more common secular models and theories. Part of the course will involve a personal improvement project in which the student will evaluate his own counseling qualifications, design a plan for improving some area of his life, put that plan into action, and then evaluate his progress as the course draws to a close.

The course will also provide the environment for self-examination for present and future growth, both in his personal walk with Jesus Christ and as a skilled biblical counselor.
