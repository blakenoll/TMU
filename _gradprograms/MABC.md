  The M.A. in Biblical Counseling is a 34 credit hour graduate degree program, designed to allow students to pursue in-depth training in Biblical Counseling.

  ### Course Formats

  Courses are pursued through a combination of on-campus and distance education courses. The program is designed to give students maximum flexibility in progressing through the degree while also strategically offering instruction in the format best suited for effective educational training--serving both distance and local students. With these available formats, the entire degree may be earned without relocating to Southern California, although local students may experience additional mentoring because of their proximity to campus and additional ministry connections with the faculty.

  Courses which are only offered on-campus--because of their unique advantage in a traditional classroom setting--may be pursued either through weekly meetings (courses meeting once a week for a 15-week period), or through intensive meetings (courses which meet intensively for 1 week on campus in July and from a distance the rest of the term--formerly known as our "Summer Intensive Program").

  Weekly courses are designed to serve residents of the greater Los Angeles area especially or others who are able to move to the area. Courses are held in the evenings Mondays through Thursdays, allowing students to continue to work in their present occupations and ministries while completing their degree program.

  Intensive courses (available only during the Summer term) are designed to serve distance students especially, those in various parts of the world who are entrenched in their current ministries and without the ability to relocate to Southern California. Courses extend from May to August, but intensive lectures and classroom dialogue are conducted in a single week period always scheduled during the last two weeks of July. Preparatory and follow-up studies surround the intensive week. Students are encouraged to take four courses each summer (which include two weeks of intensive class meetings) in order to complete the on-campus requirement in 2 years. Each student will present his master’s thesis to the faculty and fellow students on-campus during the week of graduation, which is always held at the beginning of May.

  ### Program Length

  The program is optimally completed in two to four years, but program length may depend on the student's own schedule and external commitments. Typically, students complete their course work over a two to three year period, and their internship and research in an additional year. The degree must be completed within six years of enrollment.

courses-body: |-
  ## BC501- Introduction to Biblical Counseling

  This course offers a general introduction to basic concepts and distinctive features of biblical counseling. Students will discuss what biblical counseling is and what it involves, the role of the counselor in biblical counseling, the different kinds of counseling that are needed, the place of counseling in the ministry of the church and how biblical counseling theory and practice relate to and differ from some of the more common secular models and theories. Part of the course will involve a personal improvement project in which the student will evaluate his own counseling qualifications, design a plan for improving some area of his life, put that plan into action, and then evaluate his progress as the course draws to a close.

  ## BC502 - ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF A BIBLICAL COUNSELOR

  This course will help the student to understand the Christ-like character and functional qualities of the discipler/counselor. The course will also provide the environment for self-examination for present and future growth, both in his personal walk with Jesus Christ and as a skilled biblical counselor.

  ## BC503 - METHODS OF BIBLICAL CHANGE

  This course provides an overview of the counseling process presenting a comprehensive methodological model for promoting biblical change in people. The goal of this course is to encourage biblical thinking and procedures in the process of helping people.

  ## BC506 - THEOLOGY & THE PSYCHOLOGIES

  This course is designed to critically analyze secular and evangelical integrationist theories of psychology and psychotherapy, and to recognize those theories or psychologies as part of larger belief systems, perhaps logically derived from erroneous starting points, while also comparing them to what has been revealed from Scripture and what falls into the study of theology, practical theology, and Biblical Counseling. The course will probe the anthropological presuppositions of treatment theory and seek to bring a thoroughly biblical critique to their foundational assumptions as well as methodology. Issues like theories of the subconscious, psychoanalytic approaches to personality, establishing norms, psychological testing, making the distinction between the normal and abnormal, major and mood disorders, schizophrenia and multiple personality disorders are among the psychological constructs and their popular theoreticians that will be explored. All persons encountered in counseling practice will have been exposed to foreign belief systems other than that promoted by the Scripture and, to various degrees, adopted those worldviews—even those who profess to know Christ in a saving way. Therefore, the wise counselor ought to be equipped to recognize points of departure from truth.

  ## BC511 THEOLOGiCAL BASIS OF BIBLICAL COUNSELING

  This course offers a consideration of the theological realities that form the basis of a proper approach to counseling. Special emphasis is given to the nature of God and of man (fallen and unfallen), a biblical definition of the image of God, the nature of sin, the realities of regeneration and progressive sanctification, the concept of “the flesh” (old man/new man), an understanding of the heart/mind as used in Scripture and the place of the local church in the ministry of counseling.

  This course is designed to continue to develop the skills of the graduate student with the science and art of biblical interpretation for greater accuracy in the application of truth in a counseling context. A proper hermeneutical approach will be modeled for difficult passages that are frequently used in counseling, especially as they relate to the use of texts from a variety of genres in Scripture. The focus of this course is for the graduate student to learn how to properly interpret each book of the Bible, with its special literary genre and subgenres, in order to be well-equipped to accurately apply its truth.

  **Scholarships**

  For the Master of Arts in Biblical Counseling (MABC) program, scholarships are provided through the Graduate Studies department directly, not through our Financial Aid office. Scholarships are awarded semester by semester, so anyone who wants a scholarship must apply each semester. Because scholarship funds are provided directly from our department, they are limited. Therefore, we necessarily will prioritize full-time students, and often those who are in the latter portions of the degree. In this way, scholarship applications are considered on the basis of a combination of academic performance, financial need, and ministry potential. Additionally, we do not grant scholarships to students who take only 1-2 classes per semester. Instead, we prioritize students who commit themselves to 3-4 classes each semester.

  If you would like a scholarship form, you may contact our department at graduatestudies@masters.edu or 661-362-2652. Assuming you are admitted to the program and have filled out the form, you can send it back to us at the email address. After you have turned in your scholarship form, questions regarding your scholarship status for the current semester should be directed to our program director, Jeff Miller (jlmiller@masters.edu; 661-362-2644).

  **Financial Aid**

  While scholarships are exclusively provided through the Office of Graduate Studies, financial aid and government loans can be sought through the Office of Financial Aid at The Master’s University (TMU). If you would like to pursue government aid or loans, you may correspond with our financial aid representative – Ryan Wethern (661-362-2292; rwethern@masters.edu) – in the Financial Aid Department at TMU. He will help you pursue the best course of action for your financial situation.
