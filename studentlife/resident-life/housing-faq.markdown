Adhesive putty and other temporary mounting products may be used for decorating as long as no damage results from use. Any damage to walls, doors, or room surfaces will result in a charge and must be repaired by facilities management; students should not try to make repairs themselves.

### What laundry facilities are available?

Each dorm has coin-operated machines. A washing machine load will cost $1.50, and a dryer load will cost $1.25.

### Is there a way to indicate my room preference?

The Housing Committee cannot guarantee preferences. We try our best to honor requests and want to serve everyone in the best way possible. Students may request their preferred dorms and/or roommates in the registration process, or contact Housing (housing@masters.edu.edu) to update their preferences before roommate assignments are released. If you have any questions or concerns about housing after that time, we would be happy to help you at check-in on WOW Saturday..

### Can I find out what my dorm is or who my roommate is?

We are very intentional about placing students, and we try to make each wing a good mix of different ages, interests, and majors. Because of this, new students will find out who their roommates are shortly before they arrive on campus. We will be unable to give out that information before then. You will find out your dorm and room assignment as a part of the check-in process on WOW Saturday.

### Are there single rooms available?

No, but we are sure you will enjoy the community in the dorms.

### **How many roommates will I have?**

This depends on what dorm you are living in. Most of our dorm rooms accommodate two students. Slight, however, has a different configuration and is able to accommodate 4-6 students per room.

### **Can I move into the dorm early?**

Because of our staff training schedule, we will not be able to accommodate an early arrival.

### **Do you provide a shuttle service to the airport at other times?**

We only provide a pick-up service from the airport for the Week of Welcome (WOW). Finding a ride after that becomes the student’s responsibility.

### **Can I live off-campus?**

Students are eligible to apply for off-campus housing if they meet at least one of the following qualifications: living with parents, married, an academic senior, or at least 22 years of age. You must complete an application that will be reviewed by the Deans’ Office in order to receive approval to live off-campus. The application can be found on Content Management through Self-Service under “Off-Campus Housing.”

### **What if I forget something?**

Don’t worry! The campus is within three miles of Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, and Target.
