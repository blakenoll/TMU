Dan Forrest has been described as “a composer of substance” (Columbus Dispatch), with “superb choral writing…full of spine-tingling moments” (Salt Lake Tribune). Born in 1978, Dan is a pianist-turned-composer whose choral music has already established a lasting presence in the US and abroad.

Dan’s choral works (with nearly a million in print) have received numerous awards and distinctions, including the ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer’s Award, the ACDA Raymond Brock Award, a Meet The Composer grant, the ALCM Raabe Prize, and many others. His “A Basque Lullaby” for wind band was included in Volume 8 of the well-known Teaching Music Through Performance In Band series. His music has been performed in leading venues across the country and around the world, including Carnegie Hall, the Lincoln Center, and on NPR’s “Performance Today.”

Dan has a choral series in his name with Hinshaw Music and serves as associate editor at Beckenhorst Press. He has served as an adjudicator for numerous composition contests (including the John Ness Beck Foundation and the Southern Division MTNA), has been recognized in Who’s Who In America multiple times, and currently serves on the editorial board of the peer-reviewed journal The Artistic Theologian. Dan keeps a full schedule of commissions, workshops, and residencies with churches, universities, and community choirs, and remains active as a collaborative pianist and recording producer.

Recent and upcoming performances of Dan’s music include a commission for the ACDA National Honor’s Children’s Choir (Psalm 8), a commission for premiere at the World Choral Symposium in Argentina (Entreat Me Not To Leave You), a commission for a choral festival honoring John F. Kennedy at the Kennedy Center (Washington, DC), a piece commissioned by the Tenjo Hanabi choir (Osaka, Japan) in memorial of the 2011 Japanese tsunami, a forthcoming 30-minute commissioned work for chorus and orchestra, and a 40-minute concert segment of his music for chorus and orchestra in Avery Fisher Hall at the Lincoln Center. In summer 2013, Dan will be the composer-in-residence for the World Choral Fest in Dublin, Ireland.
