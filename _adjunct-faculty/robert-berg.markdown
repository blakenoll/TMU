Robert Berg began playing the violin at the tender age of 5 and by the young age of 14 had decided to make the viola his life long devotion. He began his high school studies in Leningrad at the renowned Music School of Rimsky Korsakov and continued his studies at the prestigious St. Petersburg Conservatory where he studied under the tutelage of Violist and Professor Juri Kramarov. At the conservatory he became assistant to Professor Kramarov. He graduated in 1983 with a Masters in Music and Viola.

Although he had performed through out his life, immediately after completing his studies he began his professional career by performing with the St. Petersburg Conservatory String Quartet and working with the St. Petersburg Philharmonic. After his tenure in St. Petersburg, Robert returned to his native Prague where he worked with the Prague Symphony Orchestra until 1987. After his move to the United States, he was quickly welcomed and became a member of the San Diego Symphony Orchestra, the San Diego Opera Orchestra and the Los Angeles Opera. He has also been an active player and contributor in the recordings for motion pictures, television and popular-recording artists' projects throughout the years.
