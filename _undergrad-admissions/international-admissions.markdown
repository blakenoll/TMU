    ### 1. Request Transcripts

    A transcript is a document that reflects the completion of your secondary school education or the equivalent. Transcripts list the courses you took, the grading scale used, and the grades (marks) you obtained.

    The Master’s University prefers that all transcripts sent to us also be accompanied by an American GPA equivalent (given on a 4.0 scale). This evaluation should be done by a credential evaluation service. If your transcript does not already give a cumulative GPA on a 4.0 scale, then please have such an evaluation performed. We suggest the following two evaluators, though others are available. Look for a credential evaluation service that holds an NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services) membership, to ensure the highest possible accuracy in your transcript evaluation. Please follow the instructions on the evaluators’ websites.

    * [World Education Services](http://www.wes.org/ "WES")

    * [Educational Credential Evaluators](https://www.ece.org/ "ECE")

    All transcripts must be officially translated into English, and bear both the original signature (not a photocopy) of the school official and the official school seal.

    Transfer Students (those who have completed any post-secondary coursework) should also have their college or university transcripts submitted, likewise officially translated into English. Transfer students seeking transfer credit should make sure to have a course-by-course evaluation performed, if needing their transcripts evaluated according to paragraph 2, above.

    Please keep in mind that it may take several weeks for your school to process and mail an official transcript (in addition to the time the transcripts spend in transit, which varies from country to country). Likewise, the evaluation process may also take several days or weeks. Accordingly, please submit your transcripts requests early in the application process.

    All official and evaluated transcripts should be sent to:

    The Master's University - Office of Admissions
    21726 Placerita Canyon Road
    Santa Clarita, CA 91321
    *USA*

    ### 2. Submit English Language Test Score

    Your academic success at The Master’s University depends a great deal upon your fluency in the English language. In order to determine your level of proficiency, international applicants must sit for the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System).

    The TOEFL is an official exam supervised by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service sends an official report noting your score on the exam to an institution of your choice. You may obtain information about this test at [www.toefl.org](http://www.toefl.org/). When you apply for the test you may have your results sent to The Master’s University by referencing our school code, which is 4411.

    To be considered for admission to The Master’s University, applicants must earn a score of at least 80 on the internet-based (iBT) TOEFL or a 550 on paper-based version.

    IELTS is jointly managed by the British Council, IDT:IELTS Australia, and the University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations. Information about sitting for the IELTS can be found on their web site at [www.ielts.org](http://www.ielts.org/). The Master’s University requires a band score of 6.5 or higher.

    Registration for these exams often must be secured several months in advance. Please plan accordingly.

    Note to Native English Speakers:
    If you are a native English speaker, you should take either the SAT or ACT, in lieu of the TOEFL or IELTS. Our school code for the SAT is 4411, and for the ACT it is 0303.

    Note to Transfer Students:
    If you have completed 24 or more semester units of transferable coursework at an accredited American university or college (but not just in an ESL program), the requirements for submitting exam scores (TOEFL, IELTS, SAT, or ACT) are waived.

    ### Complete Financial Aid Application

    At the present time, it costs approximately $24,950 (USD) to attend The Master’s University for one year (two semesters). Additional to tuition are  housing and meal expenses. Books, health insurance, and transportation may be extra. The approximate total cost per year is $36,000.

    We are happy to say that—while The Master’s University is not able to give students a full scholarship—we do offer significant funds for qualified international students. We understand that this is a difficult process requiring a great deal of effort and faith. We are praying with you that God’s provision and guidance would be clear to you through this process. Currently, over 90% of our student population receives financial aid! Please note that individual awards cannot be determined until the student has been admitted to the college.

    ### Important Background Information

    You should be aware of the following regulations pertaining to international students in F-1 status:

    1. As an international student, you are required by the US government to be registered full-time.

    2. Unless you are living with a family member, you are required to live on campus.

    3. International students on an F-1 visa are only permitted to work on-campus, up to 20 hours per week.

    4. All students are required to have a computer when they come to the college.

    5. All students must have health insurance coverage in the USA.

    6. Student loans are not available, nor advisable, for international students.

    ### Scholarships and Grants

    Please Note: Applicants must submit the following three forms in order to qualify for ANY financial aid.

    1. [TMU Financial Aid Application](http://www.masters.edu/media/868180/student-financial-aid-application.pdf "TMC Fin Aid App")
       This form has now been incorporated into our online application, so students only need to complete this version if they applied for admission to TMU using a paper or pdf application. Contact the International Admissions Counselor if you are not sure whether you need to submit this application. Important note: continuing international students already enrolled at TMU should complete this form using the “Financial Aid Renewal Form” link in Self-Service.

    2. [International Student Financial Aid Supplement](http://www.masters.edu/media/868161/international-student-financial-aid-supplemental-form.pdf "ISFAS")
       Completing this form is required before international students can receive any need-based Financial Aid from The Master’s University.

    3. [Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy](http://www.masters.edu/media/868183/undergrad-satisfactory-academic-progress-policy.pdf "SAPP")
       Signing this form is also required before any student can receive any Financial Aid from The Master’s University (not required for current/returning TMU students).

    Note: The priority deadline for submitting most Financial Aid documents is March 2. Please submit your Financial Aid documents by that time in order to ensure consideration for available funds.

    As you prepare to submit these documents, you may scan and email your documents to the International Admissions Counselor, fax them to 661-362-2695, or submit them by post to The Master's University - International Admissions, 21726 Placerita Canyon Road, Santa Clarita, CA 91321

    Keep in mind that we will not be able to process or guarantee any Financial Aid until all of your admissions application documents have been received.

    Our staff is here to guide you through this process—you’re not on your own! Please contact [Josh English](mailto:jenglish@masters.edu "Email Josh English"), International Admissions Counselor, with any additional questions you have about international financial aid.

    ### Finalize Visa Requirements

    Most international students will need an F-1 (student) visa to study at The Master’s University. Once an international student receives his or her acceptance letter and financial aid award package, an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility may be obtained with the assistance of our Designated School Official (DSO). The I-20 can in turn be used to apply for an F-1 visa as a U.S. embassy or consulate. Of course, you as an individual are responsible for obtaining and maintaining a valid passport from your home country.

    Before an I-20 Certificate of Eligibility can be issued, the United States Department of State government requires that each international student be able to document his or her ability to afford an education at The Master’s University. Once you have received your financial aid package, you will be asked to submit documentation regarding the remainder of needed funds. This documentation can come from you the student, your family, or any number of sponsors. Each person must fill out, sign, and return the appropriate affidavit of support (see below) with a bank statement or letter from a bank official verifying the availability of funds. Again, we require these documents before we can begin to prepare your I-20, the document that will allow you to apply for an F-1 visa at an American consulate or embassy.

    Please do not submit these forms until you have been notified to do so by the Office of International Student Advancement:

    * [Student/Parent Affidavit of Support Form](http://www2.masters.edu/admissions/downloads/StuParAffidavitofSupport2010.pdf)

    * [Sponsor Affidavit of Support Form](http://www2.masters.edu/admissions/downloads/SponsorAffidavitofSupport2010.pdf)

    Additional information about obtaining and maintaining your visa and/or F-1 student status will be provided once you have been accepted to The Master’s University and have received your financial aid package. In the meantime, general information about applying for a student visa can be found on the U.S. Government’s “Study in the States” website [here](http://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/).
