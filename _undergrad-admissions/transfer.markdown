    **Apply**

    Create your new TMU account or log in if you already have one, and complete the online application. If you have any questions as you do that, your admissions counselor is there to help.

    <a href="[https://mastersuniversity.force.com/application/TX_CommunitiesSelfReg?startURL=%2Fapplication%2FTargetX_Portal__PB](https://mastersuniversity.force.com/application/TX_CommunitiesSelfReg?startURL=%2Fapplication%2FTargetX_Portal__PB)" class="btn btn-navy">Apply</a>

    Go through the traditional application process, which includes your online application, your essays & personal statement, your transcript and pastor’s recommendation. Depending on when you are applying, there is normally an application fee.

    **Test scores**: transfer students do not need to submit ACT or SAT score.

    **Request Transcripts**

    Check and see if your school has an articulation agreement here:

    <a href="[http://www.masters.edu/registrar/](http://www.masters.edu/registrar/) " class="btn btn-navy">Articulations</a> (select ARTICULATIONS)

    This is how you will know which of the classes you already completed will be accepted by TMU specifically from your school. We recommend only taking classes from this list, since it is guaranteed that they will transfer to TMU.

    TMU currently has articulation agreements with colleges in the following states:

    Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington.

    If your college is not listed, simply e-mail us for approval.

    2 things we need if your college is not on the articulation list:

    * Name of the college

    * Name/code/description of the course(s)

    Email this to **[Registrar@masters.edu](mailto:Registrar@masters.edu)**
- body: Once you are accepted, TMU will have your official transcript evaluated by
    our registrar. Once evaluated, your counselor will contact you and let you know
    the official results.
