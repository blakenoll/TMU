Txt Snippet: "The Master's University equips young Christian men and women for spiritual
  service and leadership - on the job, in the home, and through their ministries.
  \nEvery class we teach and every degree we confer stand on the foundation of God's
  Word. Our students acquire knowledge from a Biblical perspective, filtering everything
  they learn through the lens of God's Word. In other words, they gain wisdom to serve
  and wisdom to lead."
