blurb1-text: |-
  The Master's University equips young Christian men and women for spiritual service and leadership - on the job, in the home, and through their ministries.

  Every class we teach and every degree we confer stand on the foundation of God's Word. Our students acquire knowledge from a Biblical perspective, filtering everything they learn through the lens of God's Word. In other words, they gain wisdom to serve and wisdom to lead.
upcoming-events-text: "The things that make The Master’s University so special can’t
  be experienced on your computer....You’ve got to see it for yourself! \n\nOur beautiful,
  ranch-style campus nestled in the Southern-California canyon (just 30 miles from
  Los Angeles) can be experienced via a personal visit for a custom tour, a group
  visit with your family and friends, or in one of the many open-days.  Let us know
  when you are coming, we're excited to welcome you!"
counselor-text: "Our admissions counselors are amazing! \n\nYou want a life-changing
  TMU education, so we make sure your counselor will guide you along through every
  step  of the way to get there. Your counselor is knowledgeable in all areas of the
  university, so can provide you with fast, insightful, practical help. Select your
  state to see who your counselor is and you can even watch their intro video to learn
  more about them."
