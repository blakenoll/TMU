blurb1-text: "The Master's University equips young Christian men and women for spiritual
  service and leadership - in their careers,  in their homes, and through their ministries.
  Every class we teach and every degree we confer stand on the foundation of God's
  Word. Our students acquire knowledge from a Biblical perspective, filtering everything
  they learn through the lens of God's Word. In other words, they gain wisdom to serve
  and wisdom to lead.\n\n> \n> “I saw firsthand what TMU had done for my brother academically,
  athletically  and spiritually. So, choosing TMU myself became an easy decision.”
  \ - Jason Karkenny ('17)"
