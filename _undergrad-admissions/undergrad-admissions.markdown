blurb1-text: "The Master's University equips young Christian men and women for spiritual
  service and leadership - in their careers,  in their homes, and through their ministries.
  Every class we teach and every degree we confer stand on the foundation of God's
  Word. Our students acquire knowledge from a Biblical perspective, filtering everything
  they learn through the lens of God's Word. In other words, they gain wisdom to serve
  and wisdom to lead.\n\n> \n> “I saw firsthand what TMU had done for my brother academically,
  athletically  and spiritually. So, choosing TMU myself became an easy decision.”
  \ - Jason Karkenny ('17)"

  Our beautiful, ranch-style campus nestled in the Southern-California canyon (just 30 miles from Los Angeles) can be experienced via a personal visit for a custom tour, a group visit with your family and friends, or in one of the many open-days.  Let us know when you are coming, we're excited to welcome you!
