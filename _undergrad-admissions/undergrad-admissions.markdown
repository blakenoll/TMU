  The Master's University equips young Christian men and women for spiritual service and leadership - on the job, in the home, and through their ministries.

  Every class we teach and every degree we confer stand on the foundation of God's Word. Our students acquire knowledge from a Biblical perspective, filtering everything they learn through the lens of God's Word. In other words, they gain wisdom to serve and wisdom to lead.
