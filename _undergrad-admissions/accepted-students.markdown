Congratulations on being accepted to The Master’s University! We believe the best way to be a testimony to Jesus Christ is pursuing excellence in all areas of life. Our desire is to equip Christ-followers to go out into the world as leaders and pioneers in their field with a foundation built on Christ and Scripture. We're so excited that you've decided to join this pursuit and can't wait to welcome you on campus!

Now that you have been accepted, there are a few things we need you to do to secure your spot! (But yes... you can start shopping for your dorm room now!)

## Step 1: Accept Your Offer

This is it! You've decided to join the Stampede. Now it's time to reserve your spot in the incoming class with a $200 deposit (refundable through May 1, 2018).

This $200 deposit, which is refundable until May 1st, secures your spot at The Master’s University and allows you to proceed in the registration process. The deposit will be credited toward your student billing account for next semester, and is not an extra fee. You may also pay by phone (661-362-2237) or by mailing a check to the following address:

<p>The Master's University<br />Office of  Student Finance<br />21726 Placerita Canyon Road<br />Santa Clarita, CA 91321</p>

## Step 2: Complete Pre-Registration

Submit your preferences for housing, roommates, meal plans and other campus-related items to ensure you're ready to go on day one!

1. To begin, log in using your TMU Self-Service username and password that was sent to you in the mail. If you do not have this information, contact the Admissions Office at 661-362-2363.

2. Select Register for The Master’s University as a Traditional Undergraduate Student. Be sure not to use the pre-registration link for another program, such as Degree Completion or TMU Online.

3. Complete the information in each section. To save your changes along the way, click the Save and Continue button at the bottom of each page. If you need to log out and complete registration at another time, make sure that you have completed the current page, then click the Save and Continue button before exiting. Always save your information before logging out.

4. When you have completed and saved each pre-registration section you will be able to **Sign & Confirm** your information. Please ensure that all sections are complete and accurate before confirming your information. Electronically sign the confirmation page using your Self-Service username and password.

5. Once your pre-registration information has been submitted and the $200 deposit is received, you will be ready to schedule an **Academic Advising Appointment**. During your advising appointment—in person or by phone—your academic advisor will help set up your class schedule for the upcoming semester. Instructions for this step will be sent separately.

## Step 3: Schedule Advising Appointment

During your advising appointment you will officially enroll in classes for the upcoming semester. To make it easy, we'll have a schedule of classes waiting for you so you won't have to worry about a thing. This is where we start to see students get really excited to join #LifeAtTMU!
