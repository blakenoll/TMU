<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Work study is awarded through the Office of Financial Aid. At the beginning of the semester, 80% of your Work Study award is applied to your student billing account (for example, if your fall award is $1,250 then $1,000 was applied). Throughout the semester, you “work off” the amount applied to your student account. If you do not earn the 80% of work study funds applied to your Student Account, you will be responsible to pay the un-earned funds back to the university. You also have potential to earn all 100% of your Work Study award.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a Work Study recipient, it is your responsibility to secure a job and earn the amount applied to your Student Account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Average Hours per Week:\
$5,000 Award = 18-20 hours/week\
$2,500 Award = 8-10 hours/week</p>
  </li>
</ul>

            <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>The Master’s University participates in the Federal Work Study program, which helps subsidize our student employees’ wages. This program provides employers in the Santa Clarita Valley with access to an outstanding pool of college-age, part-time employees at a discounted rate. We place our student in your business and pay all their payroll taxes, as well as 35% of their hourly wage, which means you only pay 65% of their wage. \
\
We view our program as a way to help our community, especially during these difficult economic times. At the same time, it benefits the university, because it helps to provide additional jobs for our students, who have developed a reputation within our community for being hard-working, dependable and reliable.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History</h2>

<p>The Work Study Program was developed in 1994 to provide students with an opportunity to earn money toward their tuition and to get valuable work experience. It has also become a great opportunity for The Master’s University to reach out to its community through the businesses that participate. The university benefits as well by being able to, in effect, guarantee part-time jobs to prospective students. In this way, the Work Study Program is an effective recruitment and retention tool.\
\
The Master’s University has over 50 academic programs that draw a diverse student population representing a variety of experiences and skills. We are always looking to partner our students with employers who have similar interests and goals (eg. placing education majors in a local school). Some of our past and current business partners include: public and private schools, manufacturing and retail businesses, corporations and sole proprietorships.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost">The Cost</h2>

<p>When you hire a TMU Work Study student employee you may set their wage at $9.00 (CA minimum wage) per hour or higher. Your cost is only 65% of the gross wage, which means you pay as low as $5.85 per hour. Employers incur no tax or worker’s compensation liability and avoid the hassle of payroll entry. TMU covers all applicable employer-related taxes, so 65% of the student’s wage is your total cost. Furthermore, an additional discount is available to various local non-profit, government and community-based organizations.</p>

<h2 id="work-study-101">Work Study 101</h2>

<p>Work Study is based on “need” as determined by the FAFSA and is awarded to undergraduate students through Financial Aid. At the beginning of the semester, funds are credited toward the student’s bill and are then earned, or “worked off,” throughout the semester. Work Study is awarded in two amounts, $2,500/yr or $5,000/yr.</p>

<h2 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2>

<p>While regular, consistent schedules are preferred, flexible scheduling is a possibility as long as the student can be assured of earning their targeted amount. We ask that any employer choosing to partner with us make enough work available to the student so they can earn their Work Study award. A student will typically will need to work approximately 8-10 hrs/week or 18-20 hrs/week to earn their award (depending on their award amount and wage).\
\
Work Study students are available to work during the school year (September - December and January - May). It is also important to note that though students often are available to work during the day, many will have class and may have limited daytime hours.</p>

<h2 id="the-payroll-process">The Payroll Process</h2>

<p>A Work Study student employee works for you as a contracted employee. The student employee remains on TMU’s payroll so we do all of the processing. Each week your student employee will complete an online timesheet; you, or your representative, must verify the hours. TMU will pay the student employee by the hour for the hours submitted on the time sheet. We will then invoice you for 65% of their total pay. Each invoice is due and payable within 20 days of its issue date.</p>

<h2 id="company-requirements">Company Requirements</h2>

<p>To partner with The Master’s University through the Work Study Program, your company must be an officially licensed business, as well maintain general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $1 million for each occurrence. You will also need to be able provide adequate hours for the student to earn their Work Study award (8-10 hrs/week or 18-20 hrs/week).</p>

<h2 id="the-registration-process-and-finding-employees">The Registration Process and Finding Employees</h2>

<p>To participate in the Work Study Program, you will need to sign an Employer Agreement. You will then be given a login and password for our website, which you will use to enter descriptions for the positions available, as well as verify student timesheets. Students are available for hire only twice a year: August and January; the best place to hire student employees is at the Work Study Job Fair held annually in August.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header">Choosing a Major</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>A major in college is significant, but your life does not depend on it. You can find success in a wide range of careers and industries, regardless of your major. For some careers, a specific major is vitally important, i.e., accounting, engineering and medicine. If you pursue a career in business, a business degree will be more helpful and impressive to prospective employers, but you are not eliminated from consideration with a major in general liberal arts. Choosing the right major might mean that you will get more from your college experience, and that you can avoid additional training or education later on. So there <em>are</em> real benefits to selecting a major!\
\
Take a look at the links that follow. If you’d appreciate additional guidance and advice, go see the helpful staff in the Student Career Center.\
\</p>

<h2 id="tools-for-choosing-a-major">Tools for Choosing a Major</h2>

<p>The Career Center has a variety of tools as well as reference material to assist in choosing a major.\
\
<a href="http://www.masters.edu/DeptPageNew.asp?PageID=1163">What Can I Do With This Major</a>\
This is a very useful online reference. Scan the list and see occupations that correlate with various majors. (Note that TMC does not offer all of these areas of study.) Click on “links” to learn more about opportunities in the major.\

<h3 id="strong-interest-inventory">Strong Interest Inventory</h3>

You will not be able to obtain your results directly; you *must *make an appointment with the Office of Student Employment and Professional Development.</p>

<p>The Strong Interest Inventory is offered to TMU students at no cost!</p>

<p>Steps for Choosing a Major</p>

<h3 id="reflect">REFLECT</h3>

<p>“Know thyself” is sound advice. Don’t choose a major because someone you know did, or because someone else is telling you to. You’re different in many ways. Think about what you want to DO and then associate your likely professions with a major.\
\
Make a list of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What jobs have I enjoyed in the past?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What activities do I enjoy during my spare time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What did I used to enjoy but maybe haven’t done for a long time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do I do well?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What classes do I enjoy the most?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In what subjects have I had the greatest success?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What do I value?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would I do if income was not a consideration? What would I do for free?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-you-have-difficulty-doing-this-the-student-career-center-can-help-you-clarify-your-values-skills-and-interests-they-can-then-help-you-connect-those-chararcteristics-to-career-areas">If you have difficulty doing this, the Student Career Center can help you clarify your values, skills and interests. They can then help you connect those chararcteristics to career areas.**\</h3>
<p>\
**RESEARCH</p>

<p>Most people evaluate their career after they are in it. Their #1 concern was to get a job for income. They either thought they knew what they would enjoy, or they didn’t give it much thought. Sometimes, after they’ve been in it for awhile, they realize it isn’t what they thought it would be.\
\
You have a great advantage! You don’t yet have a career, so you can do your evaluating BEFORE you start!\
\
Talk to people in fields that you think you would enjoy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What’s it like?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the upside?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the downside?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What major would they recommend you consider for a career in this field?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend a day with them. What does that tell you about their job?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Talk with professors knowledgeable in your possible field. What can they tell you that helps you understand more about it?</p>

<p><strong>RESPOND</strong></p>

<p>Don’t feel pressured to make a decision until you are ready.\
\
Along the way, take basic required courses that will work for several different majors. Involve yourself in a variety of course experiences to “test the waters.”\
\
Try taking courses in the majors you are considering. How do you like them? \
\
Take time to supplement your formal education with real-life learning experiences. Extracurricular activities, internships, mission trips, summer and part-time jobs all play essential roles in developing your skills, as well as giving you exposure to careers and occupations.\
\
Talk frequently with your academic advisor, with your professors and with the career counselor. And, of course, PRAY WITHOUT CEASING!</p>

<h3 id="other-worries">OTHER WORRIES</h3>

<p>I Think I May Have Chosen the Wrong Major!\
Your choice of career and success in life are not necessarily dependent upon a certain major. Employers are looking for transferable skills that are developed across a broad range of studies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Verbal and written communications</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Problem solving and critical thinking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Relating to and understanding people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strong work ethic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrity and reliability</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you leave college with these, you’ll be well-prepared to enter the job market, regardless of your major!</p>
