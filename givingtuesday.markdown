This year on Giving Tuesday, November 28th, we are returning to our most vital and urgent need of the university - addressing tuition affordability.  We are praying that the Lord will make a significant impact in the lives of our students by providing $200,000 toward student scholarships at Master’s U. A generous donor will be matching the funds that come in on the day in an effort to help us reach our goal..  We ask that you prayerfully consider partnering with us toward student scholarships on this year’s Giving Tuesday to help maximize our match.  Together, with the Lord, we can accomplish the great and necessary work of attracting, recruiting and admitting the students the Lord would have receive a distinctly biblical education at Master’s.

Want to give early? Make your gift now and it will be counted on Giving Tuesday!
