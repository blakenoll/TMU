## NEW STUDENT COURSE SELECTION INSTRUCTIONS FALL 2017

---

Congratulations! If you’ve completed pre-registration and submitted your $200 tuition deposit, you’re ready to enroll in classes for the Fall 2017 semester! These instructions explain how to schedule an advising appointment, the means by which you’ll choose your Fall 2017 courses. You’ll schedule your appointment on our “Self-Service” portal: [www.masters.edu/selfservice](https://www.masters.edu/selfservice). If you have difficulty accessing your Self-Service account, please contact the Office of Admissions at 661-362-2363.

Don’t worry—you’re not on your own to figure out what courses you need to take next semester. To keep things simple, you’ll be placed in classes based on your intended major. Within each major we’ve identified a suggested course curriculum to help determine class placement. During your advising appointment you’ll be able to review your schedule to ensure that classes and times are in sync with other commitments you expect to have.

### OPTION 1: ADMITTED STUDENTS’ DAY (PRE-ORIENTATION)

The first opportunity for new student course registration will take place on campus during Admitted Students’ Day on Saturday, April 22nd. Students who register for and attend Admitted Students’ Day will automatically have an in-person faculty advising appointment scheduled between the hours of 12:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. that day. To register for Admitted Students’ Day, please visit www.masters.edu/admitday.

If you’re attending Admitted Students’ Day you do not need to schedule an advising appointment using the Option 2 instructions below, as an advising appointment will automatically be included in your Admitted Students’ Day schedule. You simply need to register for Admitted Students’ Day and make sure you complete Pre-Registration (including your $200 tuition deposit) prior to the event.

### OPTION 2: FOR STUDENTS NOT ATTENDING ADMITTED STUDENTS’ DAY

If you cannot attend Admitted Students’ Day, you can still schedule a telephone advising appointment for the same day, April 22nd . Telephone and in-person advising appointments will also be available Monday-Thursday throughout the rest of the summer, starting April 24th . \*After April 22nd. transfers won’t be able to register until May 15th . 2 Students not attending Admitted Students’ Day should follow these steps to sign up for an advising appointment:

1. Log into Self-Service using your username and password (www.masters.edu/selfservice)

2. Click on “Advising Appointments” in the left hand menu (see screen below)

3. A calendar will appear with available appointment times. Select a date, time, and method (telephone or in-person) that works best for you. An email will confirm your scheduled advising appointment.

4. If your advising appointment is by phone, it is your responsibility to call at the time of your appointment. Our phone number is 661-362-2363

**NOTE: Pre-Registration** MUST be completed and the “Confirmation” page along with your $200 tuition deposit must be received in the Office of Student Accounts BEFORE you talk with your academic advisor.

## Please don’t hesitate to contact us, if you have any questions.
