  ## View The U

  ## We Want You On Campus!

  The things that make The Master's University so special can’t be experienced on your computer. You’ve got to see it for yourself! If you’re curious about the University, your next step should be to schedule a tour.

  A *personalized* campus visit will show you Master’s in all of its wonderful dimensions. You’ll see the seniors praying together on a bench in front of the library, the professor who’s laughing with his students over a meal in the cafeteria, and the flurry of activity in the dorms because someone just returned from Starbucks. You’ll feel the crowd at Bross Court, experience the energy of our classrooms, and hear the power of our chapel service.

  Visiting our site has provided a window… and the view’s pretty good. But a visit is the door, and what’s on the other side may just be your future.

  ### Schedule your Visit Today!

  The Admissions Office is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm. During the school year, we run campus tours M/W/F at 10:30 am and 2:00 pm and Tues/Thurs at 10:00 am and 2:30 pm from Rutherford Hall. During the summer our tours depart at 10:00 am & 2:00 pm, to schedule a tour this summer please call 661-362-2602. Sign up for one today!
