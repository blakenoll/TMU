Growing up in Southern California, I knew that I did not want to leave when it came time for me to choose a college. Thankfully TMU was exactly what I was looking for, and right where the Lord wanted me! Competing in cross country and track throughout high school, I was eager and excited to run and represent The Masterâ€™s University on their cross-country and track team. My 4 years spend studying here were so impactful, that I again did not want to leave this beautiful place. I now spend my days walking incoming students through the application process. I love getting to know each student as they decide where they want to spend their next 4 years.

When I am not in the office I am likely spending time with family, at the beach or watching some baseball. I love catching up with friends, and enjoy running the nearby trails. Basically anything outdoors that involves yummy food and good people!
