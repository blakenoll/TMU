I was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois where my life was always busy. Between sports practice, chorale obligations, church events, and school I was constantly on the move. I played football, basketball, swam, club frisbee, and rugby. I still love getting outdoors, and have picked up soccer, camping, and drone flying. As I finished high school, there were multiple universities that caught my eye and Master’s was one of them. This university had a reputation that I could not ignore. So, with the plan to “get out” for college, I packed up my stuff and road tripped 2,000 miles to Southern California.

I had an awesome time here as a student. I majored in Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance. Being a student was very rewarding. I gained insight into business and all the other areas of study. Thankfully, I was able to sing in a men’s A cappella group, serve as a RA, and study abroad in Israel at IBEX. The most memorable part of TMU for me was the friendships God has blessed me with.

I am looking forward to what’s ahead. In May, I will get married to my beautiful fiancée and eventually pursue a career in financial planning.
