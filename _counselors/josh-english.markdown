I was raised in a small town in Northern California where I grew to love adventure. Excitedly I welcome anything and everything (definitely exhausting at times!), but I never wanted to slow down. This lifestyle carried over into my faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ - I wanted to do everything I could to please God. It took some time to realize that my greatest efforts could not please God on their own (phew...), but instead I needed grace through Christ.

As I grew in my understanding and became hungry for more adventure, learning, and a deepened relationship with Christ, I saw Master’s as the right choice. This was because of their dedication to Christ and His Word, excellence in the classroom, and the many opportunities for adventure. Firstly, TMU was in beautiful Southern California, a cultural melting pot and endless things one can do. Also, they had great programs such as the Israel Bible Extension Program (IBEX) and the Global Outreach Trips (GO)—thus, I had plenty of opportunities for adventure around the world. Not only did I get to pursue those things, but even more important, it was a top academic institution which greatly prepared me for the business world. I graduated in May of 2017 with a Bachelors in Business Administration with an Emphasis in Finance and Management.

My plan is to pursue a graduate degree and eventually use my business degree in a cross-cultural context in which I can also support a local church by teaching and living life with believers around the world. Right now, I am excited to be doing that here in Santa Clarita! I’m eager to get to know each and every student that is interested in attending The Master’s University from the many different countries that you represent. I pray that you will be able to have an experience similar to mine and that you may grow in your knowledge and love of the Lord here at TMU!
