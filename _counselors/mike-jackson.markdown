I was raised in the great state of Texas in a wonderful Christian home where I first heard about Master’s as my Dad is an alum of the college. I came to Master’s in 2012 to study biology pre-med and my time here ended up being more life changing than I could have ever imagined. It was during my four years at Master’s the Lord really showed me what it meant to live for Him through the examples of professors, mentors, and friends.

While at Master’s, along with studying biology, I was a part of the chorale, performed in theater productions, served as an RA in the dorms, and was given to opportunity to travel abroad to countries like Israel, France, Switzerland, Albania, and Croatia! Because of the size of Master’s I was able to utilize all of the resources and learn so much about life. The Lord also gave me brothers and sisters in Christ who I’ll be friends with for the rest of my life!

My plan is to eventually attend medical school and become and ER doctor; but I also knew I wanted to take some time off and work before starting medical school. When I started looking for jobs, I realized that I wanted to work somewhere I could invest into and really care about what the company or organization stood for. Then I realized, why not work and give back to a place that has already given so much to me? So right now I’m thrilled to be building relationships with students across the country. I love helping bring students to Master’s and watching them have their own fantastic experiences and grow in their knowledge and love of the Lord.
