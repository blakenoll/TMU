I was born and raised in the great city of Visalia, California. Most people don’t know where that is - in the middle of the Central Valley of California, nestled right up against the Sierra Nevada mountains. I grew up with the huge blessing of having a supportive and loving family. During my youth I was often outside playing soccer, water polo, or spending time with family and friends. I was raised as a Christian, but living for and pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ as my Savior was something foreign to me. It wasn’t until I attended Master’s that the Lord showed me what it is like to love and pursue Him.

My time at Master’s was filled with immense spiritual and intellectual growth. I studied Business with an emphasis in Finance and Management, and I also received a minor in Biblical Studies. What astonished me most was the Business Professors. They used Biblical principles to teach about Management, Finance, Accounting, Marketing, etc. In an environment that is often categorized as dishonest, corrupt, and greedy, it was a blessing to see businessmen living and preaching Christlikeness. The Lord used this small observation to radically change how l lived my life. 1 Corinthians 10:31 became very clear to me, “Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God”. I was able to be involved at Master’s through Student Care as a Resident Assistant ang Global Outreach Leader, which were positions that the Lord used to promote leadership growth in my life. Other highlights of my time at Master’s include going to chapel, playing intermural sports, exploring LA, going to the beach, and getting involved in a local church.

I am so thankful to be an Admissions Counselor for The Master’s University. I want others to be able to have an experience at TMU that was just as impactful to their lives as it was to mine. The Lord used TMU in my life to help me grow in my faith. Therefore, I know He can and will use it in the lives of those who attend. I am excited to play a part in helping prospective start their journey here at The Master’s University.
