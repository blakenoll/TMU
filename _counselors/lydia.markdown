I am originally from the Dallas Texas area. Before moving to California, I lived in Paris France for a year doing mission work. Now I am in California working on my online MBA through The Master’s University and working as an admissions counselor. This is an amazing place to work and study!


In my free time I like to paint watercolors, be outside, and visit fun places around Los Angeles. There is a lot to do here in Santa Clarita: great little cafes, coffee shops, museums and the beach! One of my favorite coffee shops is a local place just down the street from TMU.


Transitioning from high school to University life is such an important and fun season. There is a lot to learn and the University you chose will help shape who you become in the future. That is why I love being an admissions counselor and I am here to help you in the process.
