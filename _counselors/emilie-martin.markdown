I grew up in far northern Idaho right underneath the Canadian border. I learned to hunt, fish, camp and hike as well as ski the Northern Rockies with my siblings. When it came time to look at colleges, I briefly looked at two other schools but always came back to Masters. No other school seemed to be able to provide the high academics with absolute biblical fidelity that Master’s had provided to my three older siblings, so it was an easy choice. I loved my time here as a Liberal Studies-Teacher Education major. I was given so many eye-opening experiences from sitting in the local district’s classrooms to traveling in The Master’s University Chorale to Italy, Israel, the Balkans and parts of the United States. I also interned in multiple departments and was an RA my senior year and got to know faculty and staff and see their daily commitment and love for Christ, the university and the students.

I am so grateful that almost immediately after graduating, I was given the opportunity to continue investing in people by being an Admissions Counselor. I love getting to share my experience and help each potential student pursue what God has planned for them so that they may also have the same grounding for their faith and career that I did by coming to The Master’s University. I am currently pursuing credentialing and in a few years, I hope to be teaching and investing in students in a public environment where Christ is not as often represented.
