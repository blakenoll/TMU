  A student may also choose to test out of the 18 units by taking our comprehensive three-part entrance examination in the Old Testament, New Testament, and Christian Theology. This will certify a level of theological knowledge necessary for graduate study. The student must get a grade of 70 or higher in each section to pass that section. A student may pass just 1 section and be exempt from that course work requirement.

  Here is the study guide for the entrance exam. ([http://www.masters.edu/media/868647/study-guide-for-mabs-exam.pdf](http://www.masters.edu/media/868647/study-guide-for-mabs-exam.pdf))
