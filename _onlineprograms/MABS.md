The Masterâ€™s University Master of Arts in Biblical Studies (MABS) is a fully online graduate degree with no on-campus requirements. This program provides a systematic graduate-level study of the various sections of the Old and New Testaments. It also includes an examination of the major categories of Christian Theology, with particular focus on their application to current societal issues. Through six units of independent study coursework, the student is able to develop a more advanced understanding of the biblical foundation and methods of selected aspects of church ministry that are particularly relevant to their life situation.
