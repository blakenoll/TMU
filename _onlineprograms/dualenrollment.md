  ### Courses Available – 16 week format

  **Macroeconomics (ECN200):**

  This course is an introduction to macroeconomic principles and terminology. The primary focus is on the aggregate U.S. economy and the policy decisions that state and federal lawmakers face. Topics include: review of the economic problem, measuring GNP, money and banking, interest rates, monetary and fiscal policy, and inflation.

  Objectives:

  * Understand the fundamental concepts of economics (i.e. scarcity, choice, supply and demand, pricing, opportunity costs, exchange, consumption, production and unintended consequences).

  * Understand the fundamental concepts of microeconomics (i.e. firm behavior, competition, monopolistic completion, monopoly).

  * Understand the fundamental concepts of macroeconomics (i.e.  Productivity, business cycles, monetary policy, fiscal policy, banking system, employment, inflation).

  * To apply these areas of knowledge to practical and spiritual decisions throughout one’s life.

  **English Composition (E110):**

  The course will provide instruction and supervised practice in the techniques of effective written expression, with emphasis on analytical reading and writing of expository prose. This course includes one or more researched and documented essays.

  By the end of this course, the student will be able to:

  * Write clear, effective, researched, and imaginative projects and articulate them within appropriate conceptual and methodological frameworks.

  * Demonstrate a working knowledge of various strategies for writing, their use, and place.

  **English Literature I (E211):**

  This course is designed to present a broad overview of the literature of Britain from the early Middle Ages through the Renaissance to the edge of the Enlightenment, from approximately 700 to 1700 AD. Massive changes in language, religion, politics, art forms -- the whole of culture and society -- make this era of history both fascinating and difficult. Early Britain is largely the root source of our American culture, particularly in its Protestant and evangelical expression; much of what you are today has been deeply influenced by the texts you will be reading for this course.

  Objectives:

  * Gain a general understanding and appreciation for the literary achievements of the period, grasping the historical context of art in early modern Britain

  * Develop an ability to read and understand a wide variety of literary texts and to interpret these in the light of a biblical worldview

  * Experience personal spiritual growth, seen in an increased capability for reading non-biblical materials in a sensitive, biblically-critical mode

  * Appreciate the creative artistry of a given artifact while remaining aware of it as the product of sinful humanity

  * Be able to write about and discuss literary art from a definitively Christ-centered position.

  **U.S. Government (POL 220):**

  This course provides a survey of American institutions and processes. Included are such topics as the Constitution, federalism, Congress, the presidency, judiciary, and civil rights.

  Objectives:

  Through studying the relationship between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the student should:

  * Gain not only a new appreciation for both documents but also a new understanding as to how they fit together and complement one another

  * Gain an appreciation for the collective wisdom of the founders themselves

  * Understand and appreciate the Bill of Rights and the amending process

  * Understand and appreciate our basic political institutions

  * Develop a critical ability to analyze and evaluate the formal and informal political process including the roles of the mass media, bureaucracy, political parties and interest groups
