**UPDATE:**  At The Master's University, we consider the spiritual and physical well-being of the students under our care to be of the utmost importance. As with the alleged attack from 2006 referenced below, it is and has been the policy of The Master’s University to both comply with California’s mandatory reporting obligations, and also strongly urge all crime victims to make a prompt and full report to the police. No criminal charges were filed following law enforcement's investigation of these allegations. The university's involvement in this alleged event was limited to caring for the female student as the male was neither a TMU or TMS student and the alleged attack took place off-campus while school was not in session. While TMU is bound by confidentiality laws and policies, it is important to note that reports of the interaction between this student and members of our staff have been grossly misrepresented. In cases where students are involved in situations beyond their control, it is our policy to allow students every opportunity to complete their coursework and remain in good academic standing. Our prayers go out to those involved, and our best comfort is the certain knowledge that there is healing, peace, forgiveness, and redemption in Jesus Christ.

*(Original Statement)*
**The ministries of Grace Community Church and The Master’s University and Seminary have been informed of the blog article posted on September 18 by a Ms. Marci Preheim on behalf of an undisclosed individual. Although there are both evidentiary and biblical limitations in dealing with anonymous accusations, we take all claims of misconduct very seriously. According to our initial internal inquiry and review of the available records, we believe the blog article is plainly incorrect, a reality that we have verified with the police report on record. In addition to the various inaccuracies in the posted narrative, the male student that was accused in the official report was never a student at either The Master’s University or Seminary. In our view, anyone who would post such accusations without first verifying them has committed an unconscionable act of defamation, and anyone who would spread such misinformation is equally culpable in that irresponsibility. Should the undisclosed individual or any other person who has direct, firsthand knowledge of this matter wish to address this issue with us, we would request that they contact Kent Haney at The Master’s University who is overseeing the internal review of these allegations.**
