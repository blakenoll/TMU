Before he joined The Master's University faculty in fall 2000, Professor Jensen served for eleven years in the college's MIS Department. His previous instructional experience includes teaching in both community college and adult degree- completion settings. Currently, his faculty assignment consists of teaching introductory World History courses and functioning as the school's Instructional Technology Coordinator. One of the aspects Professor Jensen enjoys most at TMU is the opportunity to meet students and watch them progress through their college years. He and his wife, Linda, are originally from Michigan and presently reside in Saugus. Their hobbies include professional sports, museums, and good cups of coffee.
