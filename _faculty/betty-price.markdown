Prior to coming to The Master’s University, Prof. Price was on staff at Grace Community Church for seven years—working with the Logos Bible Institute, teaching in the women’s ministry program, counseling women and editing a church newsletter. After coming to the university, she worked full-time in the Student Life Dept. for many years, serving as Associate Dean of Students for 15 years, while also teaching courses for women students in the Biblical Studies Dept. She has a strong desire to see young women grow in their study and understanding of God’s Word and to be able to communicate those truths effectively to others. She has also participated in summer missions trips, some with TMC students, to the Soviet Union, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, South Africa, Mozambique, Baltimore’s inner city and a Navajo reservation in AZ. She taught courses in Women’s Ministries and Bible Study Methods for Russian graduate students in Christian Ed at Moscow Theological Institute. For several years she served on the Board of Directors of Cadence International, a missions agency reaching out to American military and their families around the world. She enjoys spending time with friends, speaking at women’s retreats and other events, leading women’s ministries in her local church and cultivating friendships with her neighbors, including sharing in a book club.
