Prior to coming to Master's, Dr. Forgerson gained extensive accounting experience working for a “big four” international accounting firm. For over ten years, he was the controller for a real estate investment partnership, and now maintains his business and accounting skills with his own tax and law practice, as well as being involved in several not-for-profit organizations as an accountant and internal auditor. Dr. Forgerson also has extensive ministry experience. He has led college bible studies, was the high school pastor at Grace Community Church, and has served as elder at a local community church. He takes opportunity to speak to youth at camps and outreaches whenever possible.
