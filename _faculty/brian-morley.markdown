Dr. Morley has taught classes in four seminaries and graduate schools in the U.S. and Europe, and has published numerous articles in reference works and scholarly resources.  He has supervised doctoral research on the improvement of higher education in the U.S., and his consulting work has included a European government ministry of education. He has taught twenty courses at TMC, including one that was awarded a grant from the Templeton Foundation. His teaching style emphasizes critical thinking skills and methods to supplement classroom instruction.  He has been a member of the Evangelical Theological Society, the Evangelical Philosophical Society, and the Society of Chris­tian Philosophers. In addition to his classroom teaching, Dr. Morley also teaches online classes in theology and philosophy. His book, God in the Shadows: Evil in God’s World (Christian Focus Publications, 2006), deals with why pain and evil exist if God is good and all-powerful. He is finishing, Pathways to God: Comparing Apologetic Methods (Intervarsity, forthcoming). He is also working on a project to bring biblical and Reformation history to life in photographs (BrianMorley.com and Flickr.com/BrianMorley). He and his wife, Donna, founded Faith & Reason Forum (and its extensive website, www.FaithandReasonforum.com) to strengthen Christians and reach non-believers. They have two children.
