Dr. Morley has taught classes in four seminaries and graduate schools in the U.S. and Europe, and has published numerous articles in reference works and scholarly resources. He has supervised doctoral research on the improvement of higher education, and has done consulting for a European government’s ministry of education. He has taught over twenty courses at TMU since 1989, including one that was awarded a grant from the Templeton Foundation. His teaching style emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills. He has been a member of the Evangelical Theological Society, the Evangelical Philosophical Society, and the Society of Christian Philosophers. In addition to his classroom teaching, Dr. Morley teaches online classes in theology and philosophy, directs the online degree in Biblical Studies, and teaches photography as an adjunct for the Communications Department. His book, God in the Shadows: Evil in God’s World (Christian Focus Publications, 2006), deals with why pain and evil exist if God is good and all-powerful. Mapping Apologetics: Comparing Contemporary Approaches (InterVarsity, 2015) surveys the differences between the major apologetic approaches, their theological and philosophical underpinnings, and how each is used. He is also working to bring the Bible and the Reformation to life in large prints of photographs he has taken, as well as building VirtualBibleTours.com and VirtualReformationTours.com. He and his wife, Donna, founded Faith & Reason Forum (and its extensive website, www.FaithandReasonforum.com) to strengthen Christians and reach non-believers.
