Paul T. Plew, Ed.D., has been the chairperson of the Music Department and Director of Choral Activities at The Master's University since 1979. He was educated at Baptist Bible College of Pennsylvania; Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington; and received his Doctorate in Education with Music specialization from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He is a member of the American Choral Director's Association, co founder and past president of the Santa Clarita Music Educators Association, and past president of the National Association of Church Musicians (formerly Choral Conductors Guild). Dr. Plew has adjudicated for, as well as participated in, numerous choral festivals around the nation. His emphasis in the classroom includes conducting, church music and choral-related classes, and hymnology.

Dr. Plew conducts the University Singers, a one-hundred-fifty voice campus choir and The Master's  Chorale, a sixty-five member, auditioned choir. He has led these groups on tours to England, Ireland, Russia, Canada, Italy, Israel, Germany, Spain, and virtually every state in the union. In May of 2003 he conducted The Master's Chorale in a solo concert at Carnegie Hall. In the spring of 2006, Dr. Plew was granted a sabbatical which took him to England and Ireland to study the life and hymnody of Charles Wesley. In 2007 he was invited back to Carnegie Hall to conduct the mass choir in "The Rutter Gloria" and Don McCullough's "Canite Tuba." His choirs have recorded for Word, Fred Bock Music, Lillenas Publishing, Ligoiner Ministries, and Pavanne Publishing companies as well as numerous custom albums for the college. In March, 2008, The Master's Chorale recorded, by request, an album for Ligoiner Ministries. In addition to his ministry at the college, he also serves as Music Pastor at Santa Clarita Baptist Church in Canyon Country, California. Dr. Plew led the faculty of the Music Department in the accreditation process through the National Association of Schools of Music, which was granted in November, 2007.
