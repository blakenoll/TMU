She has published with Crossway Books, Harvest House Publishers and started Faith & Reason Press.  She has a passion not only to research and write but to develop writers.  Her husband, Brian Morley, is a full-time professor in the Department of Biblical Studies at The Master's University, and an adjunct in the Department of Communication.
