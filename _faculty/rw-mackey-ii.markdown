Prior to joining the faculty, Dr. Mackey held administrative positions in both for-profit and non-profit organizations. During the past 30 years, he has served in several college administrative and faculty posts including Dean of Students and Director of Strategic Planning. He has been successful in starting a number of small business ventures and has been active on several boards. In addition to his responsibilities in the Business Department, he has lectured in university doctoral programs.

Because of his unique background which includes a combination of theological studies, management course work, vocational ministry and administrative positions, Dr. Mackey truly seeks a Biblical approach to managerial studies.
