Dr. Foreman first came to Israel in 2000 and met his wife-to-be on his first day in the country. He teaches a variety of classes at IBEX, all of which are his “favorite.” In addition to teaching at IBEX, Dr. Foreman also serves as an adjunct professor at the Word of Life Bible School in Hungary. His scholarly interest focuses on the use of metaphor in the Hebrew Bible and his Ph.D. dissertation was published as a book in 2011. He continues to write and publish in academic journals because he believes that evangelicals should have a voice in the scholarly community. Dr. Foreman leads the worship team at his church, where he also serves as a deacon. He and his wife Yael have three children: Yair, Jonathan, and Odeliah.
