Dr. Hild has served in the Education department since 2000, teaching professional preparation courses for teacher certification and supervising secondary student teachers. Drawing upon his more than thirty years of teaching experience in the secondary and collegiate environments, he provides instruction in teaching methodology, content area literacy, and educational philosophy. His concern is that students see their teaching vocation as God's high calling upon them and that they model biblical standards through their discipline. Besides teaching in the education department, he serves as adjunct faculty in the Center for Professional Studies. He and his wife, Tamara, maintain active involvement in their church. They have one son, Andrew, who keeps them busy with school, drama, music, and sports. They enjoy traveling to see family, gardening and home projects.
