Welcome to the Department of Music at The Master's University. Our mission is to inspire students toward excellence in every way for the Master, and we think we have a place for you!

The Master's University is accredited by [NASM](http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/), the National Association of Schools of Music. With 2 degrees and 14 emphases, our department is large enough to provide performance opportunities in state-of-the-art facilities and small enough to grant individual attention and a variety of experiences. Our Senior Bachelor of Music students recently scored in the 97th percentile in 2016 in the national standardized test (Education Testing Service, Princeton). Come find out how you can be a part of the music happening at TMU!
