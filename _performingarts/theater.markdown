  ## Mission Statement

  Theatre productions at The Master's University exist to glorify God and impact our community through thoughtful and excellent presentation of plays or musicals and by enjoying human creativity as a reflection of The Creator as becomes a child of God.

  ## Theatre Arts Overview

  Theatre Arts is a co-curricular program offered by the Department of Music, designed to give training and expression in the performing arts along-side any major at the university. Theatre Arts has been dubbed "The People's Theatre." Its participants and contributors span across all disciplines, dorms, and interests at TMU. As a co-curricular program, any participating students can receive repeating credits in either theatre arts or production techniques and this will be reflected on their transcripts.

  Following a successful opening season in 2008, Theatre Arts continues to be an amazing tool in the hands of the Lord in so many lives. We have seen the Lord display Himself in remarkable ways, showing how even a school play can be eternally significant. Lives are being changed, perspectives altered, and love for the Lord and each other continues to grow. Our productions beautifully illustrate how life is a precious gift that must be used for God's glory and His purpose; it should not be wasted!

  Opportunities to be involved include acting, stage managing, lighting, sound, scenery design, costuming, and makeup. Our commitment to the process as much as the product enables us to have an others-focused theatre program and this dedication pervades all of these areas as we strive together to serve one another using our varied giftedness.

  We are excited to see how God continues to grow the program as those involved seek to serve and honor Him first and foremost through the medium of good theatre as a gift to the audience with no compromise of who we are as children of God.

  bio-body: |-
    Tricia directs the Theatre Arts program, produces the annual Come ChristmasSing concerts series, and manages all concerts, recitals, and events through the Music Department. She is a graduate of The Master's College (MA Biblical Counseling; BA Biblical Counseling/minor in Music), where she studied voice and was extensively involved in musical theatre. She has held leading roles in several major productions including Hodel in "Fiddler on the Roof", and Marry Lennox in the musical version of "The Secret Garden". Tricia values the performing arts as a means to reflect the Creator and as a way to serve and impact the kingdom of God. She first began directing theatre in 2004 for a Christian high school; she was then brought on in 2007 to revive Theatre Arts as a part of the Music Department. Tricia has seen theatre arts function as a refining tool in many lives - shaping and sharpening hearts to live in light of the Gospel we have been graciously saved by - and used to build another example of biblical community that is a bright light to the watching world. Helping students round out their biblical worldview in the area of performing arts is a joy and blessing. Tricia and her husband, Dave - the Associate Dean of Students here at TMU, met here as students and are blessed to continue work at The Master's University together and be members of Grace Community Church.

    James has been involved with Theater Arts since his freshman year in 2007. As a student at Master's, he participated in every show the revived department put on, beginning with the role of Merriman in "The Importance of Being Earnest" in 2007 and culminating with the lead role of Nick Cristano in "Over the River and Through the Woods" in 2011. During his time as a college student, James saw the Lord use theater in an incredible way to shape him as a Christian. He is grateful to be able to give back to the current students some of what he learned through TMU Theater. James currently serves as the Student Accounts Manager for the University and Seminary. He constantly tells people he has the privilege of working his dream job, and he hopes to continue serving in both Accounting and Theater for as long as the Lord lets him.

    Elisa is absolutely thrilled to be able to invest in the growth of the program that God has used to grow her over her four years of college. She graduated in May 2014 from Master's, majoring in Liberal Studies, and double-minoring in Bible and History. From a young age, she has enjoyed participating in both film and theatre productions. During her time at Master's, she acted in "The Man Who Came to Dinner" (Lorraine), "Meet Me in St. Louis" (Tootie), and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (Ernestine). Off the stage, she served as the student production assistant for "The Curious Savage", "Forever Plaid", and "Black Coffee". Through the distinctly Biblical philosophy of theatre that this program teaches, she has learned the treasure of a servant-hearted and Christ-centered focus. Her prayer is that God continues to be glorified through the efforts of this program both on and off stage.
