about-us-body: "## Mission Statement\n\nTheatre productions at The Master's University
  exist to glorify God and impact our community through thoughtful and excellent presentation
  of plays or musicals and by enjoying human creativity as a reflection of The Creator
  as becomes a child of God.\n\n## Theatre Arts Overview\n\nTheatre Arts is a co-curricular
  program offered by the Department of Music, designed to give training and expression
  in the performing arts along-side any major at the university. Theatre Arts has
  been dubbed \"The People's Theatre.\" Its participants and contributors span across
  all disciplines, dorms, and interests at TMU. As a co-curricular program, any participating
  students can receive repeating credits in either theatre arts or production techniques
  and this will be reflected on their transcripts.\n\nFollowing a successful opening
  season in 2008, Theatre Arts continues to be an amazing tool in the hands of the
  Lord in so many lives. We have seen the Lord display Himself in remarkable ways,
  showing how even a school play can be eternally significant. Lives are being changed,
  perspectives altered, and love for the Lord and each other continues to grow. Our
  productions beautifully illustrate how life is a precious gift that must be used
  for God's glory and His purpose; it should not be wasted!\n\nOpportunities to be
  involved include acting, stage managing, lighting, sound, scenery design, costuming,
  and makeup. Our commitment to the process as much as the product enables us to have
  an others-focused theatre program and this dedication pervades all of these areas
  as we strive together to serve one another using our varied giftedness.\n\nWe are
  excited to see how God continues to grow the program as those involved seek to serve
  and honor Him first and foremost through the medium of good theatre as a gift to
  the audience with no compromise of who we are as children of God.  "

  bio-body: |-
    Tricia directs the Theatre Arts program, produces the annual Come ChristmasSing concerts series, and manages all concerts, recitals, and events through the Music Department. She is a graduate of The Master's College (MA Biblical Counseling; BA Biblical Counseling/minor in Music), where she studied voice and was extensively involved in musical theatre. She has held leading roles in several major productions including Hodel in "Fiddler on the Roof", and Marry Lennox in the musical version of "The Secret Garden". Tricia values the performing arts as a means to reflect the Creator and as a way to serve and impact the kingdom of God. She first began directing theatre in 2004 for a Christian high school; she was then brought on in 2007 to revive Theatre Arts as a part of the Music Department. Tricia has seen theatre arts function as a refining tool in many lives - shaping and sharpening hearts to live in light of the Gospel we have been graciously saved by - and used to build another example of biblical community that is a bright light to the watching world. Helping students round out their biblical worldview in the area of performing arts is a joy and blessing. Tricia and her husband, Dave - the Associate Dean of Students here at TMU, met here as students and are blessed to continue work at The Master's University together and be members of Grace Community Church.

    James has been involved with Theater Arts since his freshman year in 2007. As a student at Master's, he participated in every show the revived department put on, beginning with the role of Merriman in "The Importance of Being Earnest" in 2007 and culminating with the lead role of Nick Cristano in "Over the River and Through the Woods" in 2011. During his time as a college student, James saw the Lord use theater in an incredible way to shape him as a Christian. He is grateful to be able to give back to the current students some of what he learned through TMU Theater. James currently serves as the Student Accounts Manager for the University and Seminary. He constantly tells people he has the privilege of working his dream job, and he hopes to continue serving in both Accounting and Theater for as long as the Lord lets him.

    Raised in Northern California, Seth moved to Los Angeles to attend The Master’s University and pursue a career in the film industry. Graduating with a degree Communications, Seth has performed in two productions with TMU Theatre Arts while a student - having had the opportunity to play Nick Cristano in the Fall 2017 revival production of “Over the River and Through the Woods,” and Henry Tilney in “Northanger Abbey.” Due to his desire to work professionally in the industry, Seth is grateful to get to be a part of this Christ-centered program as he knows it is a rare opportunity in the performing arts. Theater at TMU has pushed him on and off of the stage as an actor and as a whole person being made more into the image of Christ. Now as an Assistant Director, he is excited for the opportunity to give back to the current students what he has learned through this program, as well as what he has learned and is continuing to learn in his time working in the film industry. He is excited to work in this capacity alongside the cast, crew, and fellow directors to display God’s glory on and off the stage.

    “Come now, you who say, ‘Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit’ – yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.’” James 4:13-15

  body: "$10-$25 Tickets ON SALE Monday, January 29, 2018\n\n \n\nContinuing our celebration
    of the 10th Anniversary of the revival of TMU Theatre Arts, we are delighted to
    bring this gorgeous, musical adaptation of Francis Hodgson Burnett's \"The Secret
    Garden.\" Marsha Norman and Lucy Simon's music and lyrics are a perfect addition
    to this beloved story of forgiveness, redemption, and the importance of love and
    community. After her parent's untimely death in India, lonely Mary Lennox is sent
    to live with her reclusive uncle in Yorkshire, England. Members of the household
    and community reach out to Mary to try to sooth her broken heart, but they are
    surprised by the ways she - with the help of a forgotten and secret garden - is
    used to bring them together."

    ### March 24, 25, 31 & April 1 2017

    Jane Austen wrote "Northanger Abbey" in a time when the overly dramatic Gothic Literature was quite in fashion and she observed the dangers of young people becoming too immersed in their novels. This story followed one such young woman named Catherine, making her first expedition out into the world. She interacts with real people in the real world while struggling to control an imagination that had been influenced by too many novels. This specific play was especially impactful in telling this story as it had a group of characters that depicted Catherine's thoughts/imaginations/mind. The climax of the story came after Catherine was painfully confronted by a true friend and asked "what ideas have you been admitting?" There was then a scene where she visibly had to take her thoughts captive and banish the undisciplined thoughts from her mind. The overwhelming majority of audience members were quite struck by this theme and many even used the word "convicted" by it, along with the themes of developing true character, having friends who speak the truth and not flattery, and more.

    CAST: Micaiah Christopher, Rebecca Laird, Joshua Nelson, Rebeqah James, Kaitlynn Morgan, Abigail Olson, Jon Denys, Kailey Richardson, Luke Bailey, Daniel Barulich, Seth Bowling, Katie Pennington, Beth Cathcart, Faith Gates, Peter LaCom, Jennifer Martin, Christina Meitler, Jubilee Philipp, Dustin Dudley, Jeff Caparula, Robbie Provost and 40\+ others on our production crew!

    ### October 21, 22, 28, 29 2016

    Audiences adored this classic comedy of errors! "You Can't Take It With You" delivered a fun, entertaining evening for all! Set in 1930's New York City, the Sycamore family, filled with aspiring artists, ballerinas, writers, inventors, amateur firework makers and more, seems a bit crazy! Especially when compared to the upper-crust, reliable, respectable Kirby family. But when Tony Kirby falls in love with Alice Sycamore, we start to wonder if perhaps the Sycamores have life figured out more than we think! After all, you can have all the riches in the world, but you can't take it with you!

    CAST: Daniel Barulich, KariAnne Frazer, Emilio Gutierrez, Jubilee Philipp, Jeff Caparula, Christina Meitler, Luke Bailey, Ryan Selga, Kailey Richardson, Rebecca Meitler, Chandler Johnston, Kyle Shannon, Joshua Nelson, Tamar Butler-Robinson, Elizabeth Anderson, Peter LaCom and 38 others on our production crew!
