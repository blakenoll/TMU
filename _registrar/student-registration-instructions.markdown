**Course Shopping:**\
You can start putting courses in your shopping cart now by clicking [here](https://portal.masters.edu/SelfService/Registration/ShoppingCart.aspx). Putting courses in your cart does not reserve a seat in the course, but rather allows you to start building a list of classes that will help you be more efficient in finalizing your schedule when you meet with your advisor.

**Advising:**\
After you have completed **Pre-Registration** and put courses in your cart, set up a meeting with your advisor (your advisor is listed at the bottom of the page on [this link](https://portal.masters.edu/SelfService/Records/ScheduleHome.aspx)). Bring your laptop to the advising appointment. After your advisor has discussed your courses with you and has authorized you, a REGISTER button will appear in your cart.

**NOTE:** While your advisor will assist in authorizing you, it is important that you take an active approach toward your course selections. It is your responsibility to ensure that you complete both the general education and major course requirements. To assist you in doing this, please refer to the academic catalog for the year you entered TMU. The online catalogs are located [here](http://www.masters.edu/academics/online-catalog.html).

**Registration Start Dates:** \
You may schedule an advising appointment at any time, but you will not be able to be register until the start date according to this schedule: (Please note these are completed units.)

**Waitlists:**
If a course if closed, you may add yourself to the waitlist by clicking the WAIT button. If a seat becomes available, you will be notified by TMU email. You must respond by 5:00pm the following day or your name will be dropped and the next person on the wait list will be notified.
